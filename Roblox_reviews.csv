"such a nice game, but so many bugs. You need to fix this as soon as possible mostly in mobile players. ;Sometimes your screen cannot be turn around. When you're swiping it's just zooming in and out. ;My screen will freeze for 10 sec, then when it start moving it will just shake so much. It's not a phone problem. It's the game. I've seen so many people experiencing this",4
"It's a great game, pretty much the games inside Roblox are very fun. Different genre types and more. However there are alot of problems. That being the chat filter, game bugs and alot more. Also, i would really appreciate it if you added a rendering distance option, instead of the graphics quality option. As someone with a low-end PC, this makes my whole game crash or freeze. Although all of these problems, i still find it enjoyable and fun! This game is one one of the best games Ill ever play!",3
"The game is good, they are many games to play most especially interesting ones but sometimes there are bugs in the game but I still enjoy it so that's why I gave it 4 stars so try to fix the problem about the game whereby we get stuck and the game like just begins to be in a way that every is bright and you can't see anything like it crashes so I have to restart the game before it becomes normal or sometimes is stays for a long time before it becomes normal, but this game is good. Thanks.",4

"An amazing game! Thus there is a few problems that is needed to be fixed, I mean.. Every game has its own problem, even the best games too, which is this, the number one problem is that 1) THE CAMERA, sometimes when I try to look around, the camera zooms in, zooms out or neither ( do not move) which is sometimes really frustrating since I need to RE-JOIN to be able to move my screen perfectly fine... That is the only problem I've have observed nonetheless the game is all and amazing! :))",5
"Decent graphics, everything is fine, but there are a few problems 1. It lags a lot if I enter like a shooting game it feels like it is going to crash my game. 2. Sometimes I can't control my own character. 3. It takes to much internet to play , I did like a recharge of 6 GB of internet and just gone in two days. Overall excellent game .",4
"So first, I am going to talk about bugs. Sometimes when I turn my screen, it activates the movement of walking. Please fix this because this is very frustrating and also when I turn my screen, sometimes it zooms in. And for the update, I hate to say this but I don't like it, I want the old one back. Like the 2018 stuff. Making it more realistic is kind of the reason why I would quit. But thank you for all the hard work <3",3
"ROBLOX has made my day so much, but despite the amazing changes to the game there are some issues, for example roleplaying games, the camera model will often malfunction or ""break"" so I can only zoom in and out and only face in one direction. This is becoming a very annoying situation, as the only I've found to repair this is to leave, or to go back to the editor. This is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher, ROBLOX makes my day everyday. Thank you for this amazing experience.",3
"It's a great app with great games, however lately there has been a shift lock bug. After playing games I always used to play, I suddenly get trapped in shift lock. For example, Tower of Fun, I went in shift lock for a second and then I turned it off, but I was still in shift lock. and I know I am not the only one because there have been videos proving this issue exists. So please, PLEASE fix it.",4
"It's a good app with all types of game. Although, I have a few problems. First, the camera. The camera always gets into a problem of some sort, like not being to control it properly or being stuck. Then, the search sytem thing. Whenever I search for a specific game, numerous unrelated games pop up in the results, sometimes even going first to the top than what I'm looking for. Lastly, your censorship. Whatever I say gets censored. It's such a hassle trying to communicate. Hoping for improvements",2
"There are many games in this platform, and although some games like obbies are frustrating, they taught and trained me never to give up and continue (I still rage and give up sometimes, but occasionally). But there are things that need an improvement like chat censor filters. Overall, I think this is a very good platform, because not only do you have fun at playing the games, you also learn good values like I did. I would give this a 5-star rating and I would definitely recommend it. 👍",5
I personally think that Roblox is one of the best games I ever downloaded! It can be frustrating at times as I sometimes accidently exit the app and then it glitches and makes it so I can only move and zoom. Other than that it is amazing! It's fun and time consuming and there are so many amazing things to do. Personally my fav one is daycare story. I hope that if you download this app you enjoy it as much as me. It is also ad free and hope this is helpful!😁,5
"The main issues are the camera, lag, & the lack of features. The camera is sometimes controlled with the thumbstick, and if you swipe at the same time you open then menu, you're only able to zoom in & out. The games aren't optimized well for mobile, & sometimes large chunks of the ground don't render, & allow my charcter to fall through. Along with that, in some games instead of the display trying to catch up, it makes a pop up which prevents you from moving. And on mobile, there's no library.",3
"Being on the platform has been great, but often times I find myself extremely limited in several games that include using multiple items. More specifically, due to my device, I only have 3 hotbar slots. This is an issue in experiences where you need to use many different items in a short amount of time. Opening the inventory too quickly will both fail to open the inventory and waste time. It would be preferable to allow players to choose how many hotbar slots to have, with adjusting icon sizes.",4
Love this game! I gave it a four out of five tho because a lot of people are finding loop holes for saying gross stuff and cursing. I would like them to fix that and when you are on mobile (phone) and you close out of it and go back into the app it won't let you get back into it most of the time so you have to close the app and close the tab but that's honestly it!,4
"It is super amazing with the ability to play other people's games and make your own. It also has a wide range of games from very creative developers. It has some realistic features ( RThro) but the style of things are so simple and unique. Overall, only the occasional errors are bad but I would really reccomend downloading it. In addition, being able to purchase the online currency, robux, means it is free to play most games and make a good avatar. This means ads are optional to watch. 5 stars!",5
"Has millions of great games, lots of active players, and so many different things to do! Want to roleplay? There is a game for any kind. Want to fight? Same. Though, even with it's greatness, it has major issues. For example, if you accidentally exit out of the app and go back in, the camera will move with your joystick. Most bigs like this can only be fixed by exiting out of a game",5
"This is a great app, I absolutely love it! It's just sometimes the connection is an issue and sometimes I update it but it doesn't update correctly. And one more thing, some of the games kick me out, or have bugs. It will just kick me out randomly. Can you guys fix here problems? Thanks for listening to the struggles I am having.",4
"I love this game very much. This is the best game on my phone, iPad and computer. There is one game that someone made, that it's just very realistic. Which is, Royale high. There is gamepasses that cost robux, there is nothing that is vip and it's free. But one problem, it disconnects when I'm in the middle of something, like, when I'm doing something with someone and I haven't friended them as yet. Also, it shows a black screen and goes back to the home screen. Please fix this problem.",3
"Yes it's wonderful game but sometimes, i experience in other games that when you want it to look around, it will zoom itself adn sometimes, when you are walking, the screen will automatically go down and as you adjusting it, it goes back and it irritates me, but somehow it is a nice game for friends, that's all. Peace ✌️",4
"Love this game! I love the new events which actually have good prizes and something which everyone, even people w robux would use. There's some bugs like if you're afk for awhile and turn ur camera, it wouldn't move. It would just zoom in and out which is honestly so annoying. And sometimes, even when my net is fine, it would blur the game which sometimes kicks you out of the game. Other that that, 4 star from me!",4
The game is honestly great and I love the games but could you possibly make it so we can wear multiple hairs on possibly 3 at a time because it really helps people make their characters look better. I also would really like If with the new clothing thing if we were able to wear the new pants and dresses at the same time. Other then these two problems I think the game is quite amazing I've spent so much of my time on the game.,4
"It's a good game, just one issue. I've been playing Roblox for almost 5 years now, and it's amazing. There's a small issue where when I go to change or buy something in the shop on the app (phone) it stays in the loading screen but never actually loads. The only way I can fix it is by uninstalling and installing again. Again, it's a great game but it's not a reason to not play. Please fix this bug because it's very annoying. Overall, very good game and I recommend this app.",5
"I love this app! But there's just some problems, 1st, sometimes when I walk it zooms in so is basically a zooming problem. 2st, sometimes my screen turns blurry. 3st, sometimes I keep jumping even if I'm not holding the space button or tabing the jumping. And I have to leave to fix all those problems. Some people had the same problems like me. Please fix this bug if u could, Roblox. Thank you. If u have these problems your not the only one, so is not what device your using or your device is bad.",4
The app is great but I have been facing some minor bugs which is still to this day not fixed. Im not sure if it is just me but whenever I try to play a game it shows failed to join game. It only works whenever I reinstall the app. Another bug I'm facing is the camera glitch. Whenever I try moving the screen it is straight up frozen. In most games there are ways to get rid of it and in most games there aren't. That's why I think it is Roblox's responsibility to fix it. Overall I love the app ty,5
"This game is great and that's why there's 3 stars, but the other two is 1. Because my screen goes black and I have to turn my phone back on then it gets me off the game. I know this is a popular opinion so if you can please fix it. 2. Sometimes I go on Roblox and it never stops loading so I clean out all my apps, delete pictures, get rid of notifications, even restart my phone. Sometimes it works- sometimes it doesn't. I know this game is a lot so it's hard to keep everything in order. No rush!",3
"Roblox is a great game. It has so many games which are engaging and super fun😁. I have one issue tho, I play on my android but sometimes while moving our camera. The camera doesn't move at all. And when I try to move it the screen becomes blank. The developers must look after this issue. Overall, the games is great and I would recommend everyone to play Roblox.😀",4
"Let's change up, the game isn't perfect, after that ""Big Update"" there were so many bugs and glitches, the one I hate the most is when I can't even move my screen/It zooms in and out everytime I want to move it left and right, another one is the fact I sometimes keep moving when I don't want to, and the only way to stop it is if I open the menu and close it, but there is a chance that the screen gets bugged, and the only way to fix that is if you leave the game, but overall the game is alright!",3
"A great game! It's my favorite game. But there are some errors. Sometimes I have to Re-install it if that makes sense, or restart my Phone. Also, The camera When I'm role-playing, It Will make me zoom in and out, or Make me look one way, In Warrior cats Ultimate edition, I need to go to editor To fix it, and in any other Roleplaying game, and Sometimes it does work. But it's a Super cool game. And no ads! I would Download this game, But if these Errors can be Fixed, 5 Stars!",5
I really like the game it's very fun and creative. I take long breaks here and there. I made some pretty awesome friends as well. There is one issue though. The game keeps crashing and not working for me lately and when I first started a couple months in I have know idea what happen but I think I got hacked and my device wouldn't want to work from it. But the game itself can't help that. It is a online game after all and accounts will get hacked. But over all the game deserves 5 stars.,5
"This game is Awesome, but EVERY SINGLE TIME it tells me to update it... it doesn't let me, when I have zero apps, it still doesn't let me. And it's also weird bc for certain games such as ""Natural disaster"" it tells me to play like how you text on your phone... yeah straight up and no sideways (yes I play on phone) its also weird bc when your in the middle of a game that doesn't save your progress, it disconnects you... 😵 and sometimes it's just laggy and buggy, like the game brookhaven,thatsit",3
"The game is amazing. But ever since I opened it on March or April of this year, the game stays on the loading screen and then says ""connection error"" when my connection is completely fine. Then it never actually loads. The screen just stays like that for a long time and I don't like that. Since this problem is popular, I kindly ask you to fix this.",3
"I love this game you should def download it BUT the update part is very annoying. I DONT NEED TO UPDATE OKAY. Also, there are many bugs but if you rejoin/uninstall and reinstall it's fixed. Sometimes after I reinstall, I try to log in but says password incorrect, when I KNOW its correct, so I reset password but it doesn't work for a long time. But, recently it hasn't been happening so yay? Overall: Amazing-ly sus",5
"THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. There's so many games to play along with having friends and chatting with people,and you can even make a game yourself! There's also character costumization witch is great. This game dose occasionally have bugs,but overall it's an amazing game.and if I had to choose one thing that could be added is the addition of earning robux instead of just having to buy it.",5
"I've played roblox on PC and on mobile. However, on chromebook it's very buggy. Broken features on multiple games, the mouse not locking in place, not having access to PC exclusive roblox games despite being on a PC, and images or text on groups bugging and creating colored lines across the screen. I'd love if there was a roblox for chromebook app specifically, but I doubt that'll happen. It's still playable and fun, but a lot less dependable.",3
"This is a great game! SUPER fun! Some games do glitch and lag which i personally find very annoying. This game also allows you to create your own game! This is rated 10 plus but I think it would be great for all ages! You can also chat with ppl from all around the world (and it replaces ""words"" with a #). However, it does make u update every 2 weeks or so, so if you r low on storage it might not be the best. But I tottaly recomend this game!",4
"good but I've encountered some problems 1 There's a message ""Same account launched from different device"" though I didn't even do that. 2, I use classic, never default (follow) all the time because follow mode is annoying Sometimes later in the game it switches to follow mode suddenly, even if it says that I'm classic mode or whatever 3 I encountered a problem later in the game where I cannot move my screen and instead zooms in and out. I may or maynothave experienced it now, others say it is.",3
"This is a good game and its very fun, there are some bugs on mobile within the game where your screen glitches out and sometimes when you move your screen moves with you, and sometimes you also cant move the screen so i cant really give it a perfect rating, if you can please fix the bug i would give a perfect rating and be satisfied, this game is very fun and it can inspire people to create their own games though, so the only problem is the glitches on mobile. Please fix it.",4
"This is almost one of the best games I've ever played! I would've rated 5 stars, but it glitches. It often Freezes and lags, even with full bars! It also says "" Disconnected"" or ""Connection Error"" often. Also, I've seen players being bullied and made fun of for their avatar, too. Plus....the prices for Robux are high. Its $100 for 10,000 which may sound like a lot, but some items in games and in shop can cost up to 1,000 Robux each! I will rate 5 stars as soon as you fix these issues.",4
"Hello Roblox Team! The game is really great and very consistent with it's content and updates, and is very enjoyable to play. I totally would like to propose a control optimization option where you can resize the jump and move buttons and change the positions of the jump ang move buttons on screen since it is difficult to utilize when the pair of buttons in the screen are not very customizable for users like me who have small devices. - From your Regular User :)",4
"Roblox is awesome and all and I definitely recommend but like sometimes I have issues within the game while playing mobile for example Royal high it keeps kicking me out/Glitching 25/8, Also with other games it's super slow most of the time when it comes to loading the home page and it takes a while to join a game without waiting like 2 minutes, But overall it's a really decent game just wish they could fix some of the bugs and issues on mobile devices. Thank you if you read this!!!",4
I love this game most beautiful one ever so many games some I cant stop playing! But! Few problems without these problems it would be 5* 1. Ok it's weird but sometimes when I turn my character it acts like I'm going full screen and I have to rejoin for it to fix. 2. Recently I've been experience extreme lag!!! And there is nothing wrong with my internet connection. 3. Dont make this so addicting. (I'm kidding) But these problems can get very annoying but I reccomend it!!!,4
"Such a great game! There are a variety of games and you can make favorites. Games always get updated, and roblox listens to peoples feed back. The only thing I've noticed lately is that it is unconsistent of how long it takes to load into a game. Focusing on adopt me, could someone fix the lag where when I walk through a door my pet disapeers. Also, I played Field Trip Z and I spent 35 robux to respawn. Then I immediately died the second I got in without a chance to do anything. Please fix lags!",4
"Overall I've played for a longggg time and I love it! It's a great way to socialize with your friends during the summer, BUT there is an issue with this game. Firstly, on a game([TRAIN] Spray paint, I believe), whenever I play this game it gets REALLY LAGGY my screen stops and freezes. please fix it!",5
"I love this app! Its super good! But the only thing i have a problem with is that you have to pay for just about everything (character wise) they should have more free stuff. And i have a bug that when im playing adopt me it wont load my avatar. But other than that, I love it! Its super fun and it alot of games to choose from!",5
"I have been playing this ever since I was a kid. And It is very fun and learning for survival. Especially since it has so much other types of games such as horror, mystery, survival, storys, tycoons, and so much more! One problem though whenever I have to update it says I need to some apps just so it can play, and after that it won't update, which means I can't play, please fix that! Other than that it is awesome.",4
"I love this game so much! The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star game is how many times you disconnect before you enter. Although, it has definitely improved in the past month or 2. I would definitely recommend if you want to play many different genres of games in one game. It's like billions of games in one app. I definitely recommend! Edit: another problem is that the filter system blurs out a bit to much. Numbers, names, and more are not safe from the filter.",4
"I really like the game but if you could chqnge some of the things J have encountered. (mobile) First of all, Can you please make it so that the jump button is bigger, cause sometimes when I play obbies I miss it. Second, can you put the friend requests to the top right? It's pretty annoying, For example, you're cassually playing an obby and then someone adds you and you were about to jump, you would fall and diesince it's (the friend req.) Is covering it. Please fix these if you can. Thank you😊",5
This game is really awesome but there's a problem I can't play bloxburg every attempt I freeze and my screen blacks out. Another issue the reports builder man or Roblox itself dosent read or check them which could lead to something bad actually happening. Overall this game is amazing I can unleash my creativity and express myself all sorts of ways! Hope you fix the bug I was talking about! Great game tho </3,4
"Amazing game, 1. it if your team is working on it, I can still play it. 2. I'd love it if you'd add more places to bloxburg and Brookhaven 3. Sometimes my camera will make me go in and out and sometimes when I move the joystick the camera goes with it, please fix it. That's all thank you for taking the time to read this:3",5
"I love how there are so many games and you can choose which one you would like to play. Plus you can look up certain games like horror, mystery, tycoons, simulators and more! But there are a few problems like it lags, and sometimes it lags so bad that my screen just freezes even if I have perfect connection. So if they would fix this problem it would be even better. But rather than that, this game is great and if you're like a variety of games I recommend you get this game. 😊",5
"The best game ever to play! So the problem is, 'the screen movement'. Whenever i was trying to move the screen it will zooming the screen. I can't do anything instead to leave the experience and rejoin. Or sometimes it's the opposite. And the 'jump glitch'. My avatar will jump non-stop while playing game until my friend help me. I'm not sure if i explained it perfectly but please fix this bug :)",4
"I love this game so much🖤🖤🖤,but The problem is that we need robux to buy hair, clothes, character, movements, face, and other things According to the evaluation, it is a really wonderful game. We can play with friends more than 1000 games, and we can also make game , I was going to put 5 stars but it's because of the rubox, it's easier for players to give them 5 rubox every day and why i can't log in the problem it's not the wifi it's the phone ???",4
"I love this game! It's super fun when I'm bored. I would enjoy it thought if the jump button wasn't so small for mobile device. I think a lot of the items in the shop as well as gamepasses are very spendy. Also, not sure if this is only me, but whenever I try to install roblox after unistalling the game, it usually never installs. It's always pending, and I can never get it to work. (Edit) I've changed my review, and I love it more. I still thing some items are a bit spendy, but overall, love!",5
"This game is absolutely fantastic! 🤘😝. I've made a lot of experiences in alot of games and have truly loved it through out the years I've played! 💖. There have been alot of glitches where it would automatically forget my account and I would have to restart all of my experienced lovely times, I dont know if I made the sentence make sense there, but you know what I mean. So I would like it if they didnt have all those glitches. It would be much more better. 😊",5
"I love roblox, it is easy to play and there are no ads. Robux can be a bit expensive sometimes, but thats okay. I dont have much storage space left so every time theres a update, i have the get rid of so much. sometimes its laggy but that can be fixed. There are SO MANY games to chose from! But, people can sometimes be rude. Also, when you report someone it doesnt really do anything... But anyway, its a great game! And a great way to play with friends online.",4
"Roblox is an excellent game, and I have quite a few friends and relatives that thoroughly enjoy the game. You can play games from the horror genre, to captivating, exciting adventures. Most games are smooth and stable. However, I have given this a 3-star rating because, since the big shutdown in late October, the system has been playing up and many bugs have occurred. Classic clothing and faces can go blurry in games, and so will buttons, e.c.t. Not only this, but the catalogue is very laggy.",3
"I love the game, you have access to SO many games,tycoons,obbys,etc! But there is one problem, sometimes i start playing a game and the screen just goes blank (and no,my phone didn't turn off).And when im playing i move my camera around but it only gets far or close,so then i have to get off the game,maybe they can fix that but overall it is a great game, and I would recommend it! :)",4
"It's a great platform, Really. But there are definitely a couple of things that I would change personally. First: I know you guys really want to keep everything family-friendly, but the chat filter is just ridiculous. There have been times that I am talking about my interests with aircraft, and the filter blurs out the whole sentence. No swears or anything either. It just tags it. Also, another issue is that though there are automatic keybinds for chromebooks, they aren't changeable. That's all.",4
"Really fun, great game ^^! But I do wish you could earn robux and not have to purchase them with real money. I've experienced some bugs where when I join a game and try to walk around, my screen won't move! I tried to leave and rejoin but it doesn't work, I'd have to go in first person then move. Other than that small bug, it's a GREAT game and I would highly recommend at least trying it out!",5
"This is a great game I think it's absolutey incredible that you can play a game that anyone can create for an example you can play a simulator to obbys, tycoons, roleplay games and much more! Roblox has improved a lot through out the years although I saw on many reviews that the joystick on moblie it glitches out sometimes, so I would save up money and buy a computer. I have one myself and I don't have any problems! But, when I used to have a samsung I didn't get any warnings to update the game.",5
"Believe it or not,this is the only game on my phone but there are just 2 problems. 1. When l'm in the middle of an obby,tycoon or whatever,suddenly the camera,instead of moving,just keeps zooming in and out to the point where l just have to quit it. 2. Is it just me,or the fact that my character keeps jumping up and down even when l wasn't pressing the jump button happens to everyone? I would've given this a 5 star if you at least fix these problems!",4
"I'd like to report a problem I am experiencing in a very long time 'til now, which I find very frustrating. I encounter this control issue whenever the game lags a bit, which happens most of the time. To be more specific, if I get fps drops, I am unable to swipe my screen to look around. At the mean time, I am only able to fix this problem by leaving and rejoining, which is not an ideal and a right solution in a game. Aside from this, I enjoy the game pretty much. Please fix this. Thank you!",2
"I really do enjoy playing, this is a great game! I do however have 1 little difficulty as it can be quite annoying whenever you become stuck on the loading screen or the game just quits and completely closes. Apart from them which could possibly be my fault?- The game has amazing graphics, and its a really fun place to connect with friends or meet new people! However remember you do have to be careful with things like this since it is an online game but I do recommend playing! Stay safe! xx :)",5
"This game is great! I love playing it! It has so many fun games to play! Although I do have some problems. I play on a chromebook and when I switched from using it as a mobile to a computer, I had many problems. It had disconnected me many times even though I have great wifi, its been kicking me out of whatever game I'm playing and going back to the loading screen, and I couldn't walk. The tags can also be a problem, and I when you block someone, they shouldn't be able to join groups you make.",4
"Its been better, although I still experience the lag and I think I've experienced a bug so basically when shopping for clothes for too long the app will turn the screen white you can't do anything you have to restart the games which is really annoying. I don't think I have this issue anymore but still, please check and fix this. Thank you.",4
"This game is great, you can play or create games of your choice and create an avatar! However, recently I have been experiencing a bug were basically after every few games I join, my camera will lock onto the back of my character and you have to turn the app on and off in order to get it to work again, but even then it still continues to do it. Even after RESTARTING the phone, its still doing it. I have seen a few other people write about this as well and its getting seriously annoying now.",4
It is a nice game but I really wish you can just have robux not having to pay for it. Another thing is some games you can't play cause you need a newer device. But I do like you can play with friends and family ☺️ And there is so many games you can choose from! But some games are very laggy. Another thing is some games they dont save your progress it is very annoying cause what if you were like you had one more floor to go and you left and came back the next day and all you progress went away!!!,4
This game is soo good . The animations and graphics are so amazing . I like this game so much. I also had a problem in which the game just doesn't work but I think the others had the same problem. Beside all of this the game is amazing and its true that there are game passes that many can't buy but remember by doing hardwork you can achieve anything.,5
"I love this game so much but since I play on a tablet it always kicks me off and it also takes up alot of space. It's also really glitchy for me, it's super annoying. I also play on XBOXONE and I figured it doesn't let you play all games for example Brookhaven. Apart from those things, amazing!",5
"This game is really fun and addicting to play! I've been playing this for 4 years :) I would rate this a 4-5 stars. But there are some things that always get on my nerves: 1. Some games are laggy to play and low quality 2. Always got the kicked client thing 3. And lastly, whenever i walk or jump or fall, the screen stops for a second and go again That's the only thing i wanted to be fixed:) Thanks!",3
"This game is so good and I'm playing this game since 2 years already and i really liked this game. The problem of the game is so much bugs like ""launching experience"" this 2 months i experienced it and i waited 3 months and after that i can play again. And there are many more bugs such as sliding in the games joining and other issues, but this game is really fun 😊.",5
"I love roblox! Only a few problems, sometimes it kicks me out and I have to make new account or it lags, it can be very annoying. When I get into a game after like 10 mins it kick me out saying I got disconected! If you can fix this pls do. Other than that I think this game is great! I reccomend it for sure! {Thanks for no ads!}",4
"It very fun and I have played it for entire years, the excessive amount of user made games with every genre, fandom, and Everything else. You can find almost anything here while most of the games aren't that fun to play your basically guaranteed to find a good game that you can play for days on end, Roblox also doesn't bombard you with ads for every time you move the screen, but their are in-app purchases that you can use to stylize your character and give you a little boost in the games.",5
"Wonderful game! Included great graphics for some games! One thing though, either this is or isn't their fault, which is my mistake and im sorry for blaming them, but they keep removing features of some items in the avatar shop. Some of which have been made quite worse, or have been deleted for no good reason at all. Many popular items also have been removed, such as UGC items, which have been deleted without explanation, and I'm quite confused about that. Overall, really good game!",4
"The best metaverse there is! While there is lag it runs surprisingly well on my 60$ tablet, the only exception is in bloxton hotels, but on meepcity it can easily run every player! The only games that crash sometimes come from fast movement or objects taking up all 2gb of ram, but other than that, you could probably play this on a potato in 2009",5
"I Love Roblox! It's for sure a five-star game. But I do have some issues. 1. Sometimes when I get on some platforms it just kicks me out and puts me back on the checkpoint. 2. Sometimes when I fall it just freezes in midair. 3. Sometimes when I jump and I get back on the ground, my character keeps jumping. 4. Sometimes when i zoom in or out, it acts up or freezes. Despite all the issues of the Roblox games, Roblox is the most fun block game of all time!",5
"This game is very fun, however, when I'm in any game and click the Roblox button at the top left and then exit out of it, I can't look around (I'm on mobile). When I put on 1 finger on the screen and drag to try to look around, it just zooms in and out. It's only supposed to zoom in and out when I put 2 fingers on the screen... So that makes me have to rejoin and it's really annoying",4
"Hello! I really like this game! Its my fav! but there are some issues that happened to me sometimes 1. Sometimes the screen cant rotate / move my screen. 2. Whenever i move my joystick the screen is following where it moves. 3. It lags very much sometimes also crashes. 4. Lastly, Some items i equip just disappeared it is all the issues i have",5
"This game is the best I've ever played I recommend this game but there are some bugs : First, when you leave your screen for seconds, the screen will freeze and it happens often in mobile devices. Second, I always stuck in the screen lock and when I joined other game it still happened to me so I have to reinstall it😩 I hope roblox can fix this bugs soon",5
"This is a really good game, but with every good game come glitches. Thankfully, the development team patch and update the physics engine regularly, but there are still many glitches left to patch. One glitch i really want fixed is a render distance bug, which automatically alters the render distance (at lower graphics levels, when it's set to manual) from around 300 studs, to like 5000 studs at random moments, causing lag spikes for lower-end device players. Other than that, it's really good.",5
I do love this app alot and i think it is an amazing way to spend your free time but I do think the robux and the items should be a bit cheaper. I have also been experiencing a bug where the picture on the front of the game is staying the same even when there is an update. Please fix this and i would rate 5 stars.,5
"This game is amazing. I've been playing for a few years now. I love that there are no adds. And there are plenty of games to play. My favorite game so far is royal high. But over all I recommend the game to anyone who gets bored easily. However ive been having a few problems, Everytime i try to play a game it will always lag even though i have perfect internet connection, and when i go to buy some cothing items for my avatar, It never loads. Please try and fix it.",5
"I enjoy this game alot but some bugs always kick in, The first one is when even you change your avatar and join a game, you get free shiftlock that you can remove by reseting or leaving to go to another game. The second bug is the screen of mobile/ipad players, sometimes when you lag, your screen will stay in one place and whenever you move it, it zooms in and out! You need to leave and rejoin the game. Thats all good game by the ways",3
"Good game, very fun, some bugs such as movement and movement of camera but other than that it's great. Some people complain about it not running well or ""bad performance"" when really it isn't the game but the device itself, the device needs to be able to run the game. So depending on your device your gameplay will be affected. Good device = good gameplay. Bad device = bad gameplay.",5
"All of the games are amazing. But I do have one issue; I have an Xbox and I play roblox on it sometimes, but sometimes it gets very annoying because I have to press on a specific button to do things. It would be a lot easier if you could possibly make it so that Xbox players can play easier. Overall, it is an AMAZING game and I would DEFINITELY recommend it to A LOT of people! 🤩",5
"A very good game! Have been playing it for over 3 years and I love the energy. My only complaint would be that I do get really laggy. Also I would like to be able to have more friends more than the max limit since I meet a lot of amazing people on here. Also, whenever I go to the menu/roblox icon for a bit, it glitches so my joystick seems to control the screen which gets very annoying. I'd have to leave the game to fix it. All of that aside, this game is a work of art and it is a master piece.",4
"Overall a very fun experience, many of fun games for everyone of all interests, but I've noticed a few interesting bugs. The screen sometimes locks itself without user permission and unless the game has a teleport, it doesn't budge. I've also realised that the application DOESN'T let you access the site if you don't completely close out of it, it instead sticks on the loading screen. That's all I can think of for now, 4 stars!",4
"This app Is incredible for many reasons. But the glitches are very bad in some parts of the games. All though the graphics are amazing and the games are very fun! I also don't really like the fact that some clothing from the Avatar shop for your Avatar just does not show up anymore on the list of your clothing! Although this is a easy 5/5! Please change the bug fixes! It would be appreciated, and for a lot of people!",5
There's been an issue where the camera will go wacky and it makes it very very hard to play and you usually have to leave or reset to fix it. You can get so far but have to lose it all. Another thing is the game will crash for days on end and it always scares me my acc has been lost. Finally I've had an issue with the chat where the keyboard won't pop up or take a painfully long time to load. When you play you'll understand But other than that it's FANTASTIC!!! (Just check yt if it crashes),5
"The before was actually good, but now it's kind of going down, like really down. Edit : This comment was edited on April 12. 2022. This game has been wonderful, I take back what I said. The place is perfection. I have made so many friends. A perfect place for me. But there's one annoying issue, The screen kept frozen at the same place multiple times. The screens kept moving to where your joystick is going (these bugs occur only in mobile.) But still a good game though. Might be annoyed with it.",5
"IT'S A GREAT GAME LOVE IT!! But there are some things that REALLY annoy me, like having to upgrade it every month. For example, I haven't used my account for a while and I have to upgrade it every time I don't play for at least a week. Also whenever I play adopt me or brookhaven, the keyboard always goes down and it takes for ever to get it back. But everything else is great!",4
"This game runs good, but whenever I'm playing in a server and click the Roblox button at the top right then go back, the camera will move down to my characters feet. It's so annoying and it ruins the experience because I'm usually roleplaying when this happens, so I need to leave and rejoin to fix it, but I end up in a complete different server. It's upsetting needing to leave my friends because of this weird glitch. I wish it was fixed. Please do so. Thank you!!! 😛",3
"In my opinion, this game is amazing. I have a whole youtube channel about it. (Jill and Edi♡) And it is just the best game I could've ever expected. It has tons of games all in one and is awesome to be able to hang out with your friends. However, there may be a lot of glitches on mobile. For example, sometimes you're not able to move your screen. Plus there's a lot of updates, sometimes I don't have space to upgrade it. Please fix this. And all of the glitches, well they're all really annoying..",3
"Good very good just sometimes it gets a little laggy but its still a awesome game! So many things to choose from! The only down side is that if i leave the game for to long I'll come back and it most of the time kicks me out because of ""no wifi"" and/or takes forever to reload. Also once and awhile there will be a problem with the whole game its self, I think maybe because of all the updates.",5
"The game is great overall, but occasionally while I play the games, my camera will occasionally break, either being unable to move the camera at all, being stuck in one position and can only zoom in and out, or when using the dynamic joystick the camera moves while you move, and one the most annoying is being unable to zoom in or out, and especially so if you had zoomed all the way out to get a feel of the map. Otherwise great game.",4
"This game is amazing! But the robux is slightly overpriced. 10,000 would be around €100 which I would say is a but overpriced. There's one other bug that I hate. The camera bug. If I wanted to check if my friend is online while I'm walking, it just breaks like when I walk after, the screen moves while I'm walking.besides that i love it. I did quit for a while because of toxic players but I don't really mind them anymore. Please fix the bugs it would mean a lot to me.",4
"It is a nice app, I can do everything here. But I've been experiencing some small bugs but it's not financially a big problem. Sometimes, it would fail to teleport me, and it would just zoom the screen in and out so I have to close the app and come back again. And also, there are times where the screen would just be loading when I join a game, my internet is perfectly fine but it's not much of a big problem. But overall, I'm rating this a 5/5 'cause it's very nice.",5
"Very good, I haven't had any problems with this app, I personally think it's a pretty good app. There are tons of games in just one app, I think it's pretty nice... although I do have some suggestions, First, maybe let us earn robux instead of buying (I don't have any problem with buying though),Next, more free hair most of it is pretty basic (everyone wears it), Lastly, add more theme colors, like red,blue,pink, yellow, or just have a color swatch.",5
"This is a great game. Although it has some errors, lags and glitches, those other ones are not so bad. But, I found one that really messes me up. When I want to design my character into a blocky and once I save it. In the left arm, there isn't the 'woman hand'. Please fix it! Overall the game is a great timepass with excellent game play.",4
"This is a very fun game and I totally recommend it, my only concern is that sometimes if I do two things at once, my screen goes crazy. For example if I drag my joystick up to go forward, I go forward but my camera starts looking up. Leaving and coming back fixes it but tycoons don't save progress and this irritates me most on battle tycoons because I lose my weapons progress. But besides that, this is the best game I've played!⭐⭐⭐⭐",4
"So the game is great but there is this annoying bug that a lot of people have already mentioned, the camera bug, basically instead of turning around you start zooming in and out, the worst part is that you can only solve it by entering a screen lock cutscene, that most games don't have, or by quiting the game. So yeah please fix it Besides that, overall an amazing game",5
"Roblox is a great game! You can customize your avatar, and play many different games with other people! But, I am having a very annoying issue. Whenever I play a game, any game it doesn't matter, Sometimes my joystick will glitch out and whenever I move my 3 person view would be following my joystick and make it hard for me to play. Please fix this bug! Otherwise great game! ⭐⭐⭐⭐",4
"I do enjoy roblox, but I have an issue. for some reason while I'm playing on mobile, I suddenly won't be able to move around while also moving the camera around (with the dynamic thumbstick and follow settings I think) I cant do both at once, which makes it difficult to play and ruins the experience. The only thing that fixes it *temporarily* is if I turn off my phone then turn it back on and continue the game, but sometimes that makes me disconnect from the game.",4
"This is a great game and there's so much you can do. But there's 1 bug that greatly annoys everyone. The camera bug. It's so irritating and the only solution is litteraly having to leave the game, which technically isn't really a solution because you could be doing something important and then you lose it if you rejoin. It gets stuck in the worst places and especially for mobile users when you press the walk button the camera moves as well. So many people lost data from this bug. Please fix it.",4
"Roblox is a great game. Especially through covid and all of this it's been extremely distracting and fun, not to mention it has the ability to allow you to interact with people around the world. Though a problem I've been experiencing is that:sometimes when I speak or go to say something in chat I get completely logged out of the game and it crashes. I feel like that's an easy fix and it doesn't make much of a problem, it's easy to get around and doesn't happen often, but becomes irritating.",4
"Love the game! I love the interface, it's super easy to use and navigate. It's cool that your able to customize an avatar, but I wish it had more free (full) outfits to choose from, instead of having to but it. Also speaking of that, there should be a way to get free robux. Maybe by watching 3 ads a day (idk just ideas), or maybe you could get a free gift? either way, great game!",4
"This platform is rather enjoyable when playing the right games, but there is one issue that prevents me from rating this 5 stars; the camera bugs whenever you tap the screen in a way that is too much at once, or when you tap the menu and hold at the same time. This is really problematic, as fixing it temporarily requires you to literally leave the game. Sometimes, the camera bugs for literally no reason, getting stuck at the worst angles. You need to fix this bug, we're all so tired of it.",4
"Games are very enjoyable, but for most of them my character lags and goes really slow. This is only happening to me (from what I know), so it may just be a user error. Additionally, the ""Robux"" seems a bit expensive. I would like to be able to earn it through games or selling avatar clothing, hats, etc. My personal favorite games lag a lot. I like to play on my touchscreen chromebook. For a few of the games I play, it is only for ""mobile screens."" This limits my options, which upsets me.",4
"This game is amazing in many ways!! Though, a reoccurring problem has made it hard to play. Ever since I switched phones to my Nokia, the game started thinking I was on a computer, making it hard to play. With an enlarged screen, it was hard to jump and I'd end up having to reset or leave the game if I went into a sitting position. It would mean a lot of you have advice or could fix the problem! You guys are awesome for creating such a great game, keep up the good work!! 💪",4
"Overall, I like this game. Most of the servers run pretty smoothly, and the overall experience is pretty fun. There are only a few things I'd like changed: 1. I wish I could get Robux without paying actual money 2. It would be nice if there were more free outfits/hairs/facial expressions 3. I would like it if I could get Roblox Studio on a Chromebook, iPad, or tablet (it's only accessable through Macbook or Windows) For the most part, it's a good game.",4
"This is definetally a 5 star. You can choose from an endless amount of games, some roleplay, obbys, tycoons, and much more. I recommend trying it. Also you can meet new people. You can also message your friends, chat, and explore. Contains in game purchases though. Although every once in a while there are updates. Sometimes they can take a long time, that would deduct but the game is too good for that. Maybe it is an old device problem or something with the wifi. But if not, please fix it.",5
"This game is amazing, I love playing with all my friends and going to social places like royals high or brookhaven!!I it's just the game has a few bugs that are really annoying,like whenever I type in the chat for some reason I accidently click the settings button and my screen goes un a 360 mode,then octave to rejoin back because resetting doesnt help and I can't stand it,if you can fix it that would be amazing!! Thank you very much and have a good day!!",4
"Amazing game, sometimes laggy but it's still good. I've been playing Roblox for 4 and a half years now, there's been fun things to do, creative games, amazing players and finding new friends! The ploblem is about the Mobile devices, you're screen sometimes glitches, you sometimes can't controll the movements. I wish they can add something like refreshing you're screen so it doesn't get stuck. But overall a great Experience! I can't wait for the Future.",4
"Its good! But a few problems... This app is fun and amazing, but there are a few problems about Moderation. First of all I think you should make it so we can add images to our reports, say I was playing free draw or spray paint, if someone drew innapropriote/curse words, if I reported them it would be considered false. Second of all, there are alot of free robux scam games that are still up. I would like it if you made moderation a bit faster? Thanks for taking the time to read this.",4
"Very fun game! I love that there's different games you can play! But, there's one thing. I know this is the creator's choice, but I don't like that you have to pay for some games. For example, Bloxburg is my all time favorite game! I didn't have a problem at first paying, but then it became a problem because of 1 reason. 1: The process of buying stuff with robux is very confusing, and sometimes lags and takes your money but doesn't give what you bought. It took ALL of my robux. Love the game tho",4
"I play on mobile sometimes, and there is a screen bug. But i found a way to fix it! Note that this only works in some games, but to fix it u must trigger a cutscene, any cutscene! Like in slayer tycoon there is a girl that will buy the wood you collected and it'll trigger a short cutscene and after the cutscene my screen was working well! And the game is pretty good! If u get bored of one game there are still alot more to play! Overall really good!",5
"It's fine it's glitchy it needs to be done for me but it is good you can purchase free stuff but from others we need robux and it costs a lot of money to buy robux but it's cute and a lot of fun to play with. So many games too. But at may 4 the games is only sponsored. So thanks for fixing some of the issues. And games or more, but we actually need more free stuff like the classic shirts, t-shirts, and classic pants. But there's more problems. Fix it pls if you guys can.",3
"Roblox is overall a great platform, I only have two complaints. The first is that it seems to run very slowly on my Chromebook - it can take up to 2 minutes just to open the app. The other problem I have is that I've noticed Roblox has been going down a lot more lately and I regularly have problems on it relating to outages. Apart from that, I have no issues and I'd recommend it to anyone of any age because of the huge variety of experiences.",4
"Cool, it's a great game, I dont experience a lot of bugs but.... it's all ways laggy and I zoom out instead of moving my camera sometimes on phone but on computer it does not happen. Overall it feels like there are more bugs on phone than computers, please fix that for mobile or iPad users. But for me, I rate it a 5/5 since I use computer more and it's great!",5
"I've been a player since 2019, i really like the game so much. There is a little problem on the game. When i play, it actually kinda lags and like, the game freezed (the time when you type something and it doesn't and send every one is freezed)(and it happens all the time. Well, sometimes, i suppose.). I don't know how to explain it, but i hope you understand this, Roblox. Please, it has so many updates and it still isn't fixed. I hooe you can fix this problem asap(i like your game though!).",5
"The game is great, but I've been having a lot of problems with it lately. Recently, it's been randomly closing me out of avatar editor and catalog; leaving me on a blank white-ish gray screen. It has also been just closing me out of the app itself when I'm scrolling through catalog. Edit: Lastly, after I changed my username, I have been locked out of avatar editor. I'm just stuck on a loading screen. My WiFi is fine so this must be a problem in the app. Please do something about this!",1
"This is overall nice game! But the thing is.. Actually in some games when you are in settings (I think for mobile players) and when you come back from settings, When you walk your screen is going the same direction as you walk. So its terrible for the rest of the gameplay. And the way to fix it by reseting character, sometimes dosent work, sometimes does work and fix the walking problem but lose the progress. 2nd your outfit go blurry after 15 mins or less or more(for mobile players I think)",4
"A good app for playing with friends! Unfortunately, theres a few bugs. So first, for some reason half of the time I play a game or check my avatar my clothing has become blurry, when I join a game it does that to everyone clothes. I asked a few of my friends and it doesn't really happen to them, maybe because of my phone but if not please and try to fix it! Second, Everytime I accidentally click the menu by accident, my camera freezes. It's annoying just rejoining everytime. Thanks for reading!",3
"I like this game it's really fun I can play with my friends but some reasons I don't like it, 1. Chat filter. Sometimes it doesn't even let me say ""Hi"". Super annoying please fix it. 2. Controls. It's much harder on Mobile than it is PC, for example, Jailbreak, to use rocket fuel, I'm on a phone so it's a small screen, I have to reach my hand to the top of the screen while driving and that makes it much harder to drive.",4
"This game is one of my favorites, the only thing I have to say is that, the graphics quality for my computer, can't be put higher than 4, even if I'm just trying to see further, then my quality goes up, and crashes my game, I think it would be a good idea to have something like Minecraft, where you can change the quality, and the view distance.",4
"The game is really buggy and has a lot of glitches that can be improved. For example, while using the dynamic thumbstick, sometimes your camera goes crazy and decides to no longer work, forcing you to use your thumbstick. Another example is when you can't move your camera, forcing you to rejoin the game you're playing entirely.",2
"It's a fun game and works really well!!! The only draw backs is that some of the games only really work on one device. Like some games only work with a computer, and others with a touch screen. Another draw back is that for it to work well it requires lots of internet and space on you device. Otherwise then that it's a really fun way to connect with friends!",5
"I think it's great, but it crashes after a few minutes no matter how many times I try. I tried restarting my laptop, reloading, and logging in and out but nothing works. Otherwise, I think it's great! You can play tycoons, obbies, simulators, customize your character,and so much more!",4
"Its so fun to play this game. Its have a lot of games,parkours,action,survivals,and RolePlays! But theres a bit problem. Maybe its my phone or the game, when i walk, sometimes it walk by it self straight, and if i press the menu button, it stops, and when i move my camera screen, it actually zoom, and if i walk, the camera screen moves its self, so i think it is may a bug or it is by my phone. So i rate this app because it is super fun for everyone, and i like blocky games.",4
"Love it but sometimes when i accidentally click the button that shows people in the server or if you want to leave etc. it sometimes, when i try to change the way i am looking, it just makes it zoom in and out. Please fix this. Overall it is a wonderful game.",5
"The gameplay is better i guess, I change my mind about the game a bit, its a good game, and its excellent, however the most annoying thing is lag the bugs. You barely pay attention into fixing bugs and most events have become utterly pointless, being just ads. The gucci event is literally the only event in this current era that is actually a real event.",4
"It's a pretty good game - but a lot of problems- whenever I play a game- the camera acts weird after a while sometimes- I don't like it. And also, it's so annoying how glitchy it gets-and on an iPhone? They're the newest brand phones! Their not even supposed to glitch that much!! >:( But otherwise, it's a nice game.",4
"An amazing game. There are so many different types of games and groups. I would reccomend it to anyone searching for something new to pass the time. The only problem is that their darn chat filter wont let you say the simplest things. Also alot of times it's pay to win, I wish you could do something to earn the in game currency for free, like daily and weekly challenges.",5
"Good Game, but there's a problem. When I play a game that offers noclip, I sometimes use it and nothing happens. But yesterday, I used it, and it glitched and didn't undo. I thought it was a bug and I closed roblox and reopened it. Turns out, it spread to other games too! I had to uninstall and reinstall just for it to stop. Please fix this!",4
"Amazing 🤩 many games to explore and experience! But the one thing Roblox has to get rid of is the hackers. It isn't fair of how hard people work for their Roblox account and it just goes to waste. Please fix this as best as you can. I have been hacked before and I hated it. I still continue to play now but it's just not fair. I hope you can fix this. Another thing I have noticed is in most of the games we are all blockys. I hope you can fix that too. But overall, the game is great!! Love it!!!",4
It's very good just that they don't fix many mobile glitches. Like if you move the screen and accidentally open the top left menu (this happens all the time) you can't turn your screen and have to rejoin to get rid of it. This affects games that reset progress like a lot of tycoons.,5
"I love this game.... It have a thousand game...but there something that i don't like. Which is we can't say number. And always laging. Hope you fix better next time, and for who can't move screen and its move when you walk, reset character, and for who always got jumping spamming bug, its just glitches, its happen when you teleport or die and you keep clicking jumping, so you must click the roblox menu and close again, (roblox menu that have roblox logo on top of your screen)",4
"This game is so fun, different kinds of games and lots of activities. Download it and try it! The only problems are that some games falsely disconnect you and it takes about three to four minutes to reconnect. The lag on tablets and phones are annoying aswell and more games need to be mobile compatible so other people who don't have access to PC/Laptop will have chances to play awesome and amazing games out there. (iPads and iPhones (iOS Apple) aren't as laggy but do disconnect falsely often).",4
"Excellent app , it lets you play , create , design and many more you can join any game . Almost all the games are free and there are a few games that are locked and require robux but thats fine . Its laggs alot in a few games thats a bit annoying otherwise its fantastic. You can design your avatar however you want and you can play and chat with your friends too! Thats too cool!",5
"It's nice! BUT... My requests and issues are the Lag. Like when I try to play any kind of game, it's really bad with how much quality and lag with it. Please make the Lag issue be fixed. And even when I'm on a Samsung tablet. And make Tasks to earn robux instead of just using real money, cc, etc. It would have made it alot better. Or make a better avatar maker. Like width, height, well differently. And adjusting to. Because sometimes it could be helpful.(with a limit). Thank you.",4
"The game is Kind of glitchy and crashes sometimes but overall it has pretty good graphics and games to play . Most of my favorites are Cos(creatutes of sonaria) , Rh , Adopt me and some more! Some games are based on Fantasy books, lore or school in real life! or stuff . But otherwise it's a pretty good game! I just upgraded the game. And it's genres are Rpg , Adventure , Fantasy & more , But one major problem. Mobile players cannot swipe their screen when they accidentally press on the rblx logo",5
"I love this game! I enjoy playing this game with my friends and younger siblings, also with meeting new people, yet I have experienced some problems lately. Roblox has been pretty laggy for me and I've been kicked from several experiences. Also, my profile won't show up (which I don't find much of a problem). I also have a hard time moving my screen, to the point where it won't move at all, and sometimes even moving my character.",4
The games great but there's an extremely annoying glitch in pretty much all games where when you press the player menu it makes your camera (the way you view your character) go funny and the only way to fix it is to leave and rejoin. I would love it if you could fix this so I dont have to keep rejoining the games! Thanks!,4
"Hi developers, i know you're actively working on this, but there's a new bug. It doesn't let us see our friends and everything is blank. We can't see the popularity of the game, please fix this! (Edit) It's been a while since this was fixed and i didn't edit it yet, but thanks for fixing it!",3
"I love the game, there's so many game variety like: Roleplay, Tycoon, Adventure, and more! But 4/5 stars because the updates are really annoying, taking to much space for me to have all the games I play (Wich is 5), and because it gets updates so often means I have to delete a game I play a lot, wich is very agrivating, so can you only update it if really necessary? also there's a few bugs, like my screen randomly locks, or my screen starts to be controlled when I try to walk. (both on mobile)",4
"I'm having alot of problems with the app, I've been playing since 2017 ish? But never experienced anything like this before until now. Recently the app has been freezing, whenever i join a game, the screen goes back to the loading screen when you click roblox in mobile. I have a very great connection yet it sometimes does this and i can assure you I'm not the only one experiencing this since my cousin has been having the same problem, and no. We do not have the same wifi connection.",3
It's great!The only trouble I have with it is that it lags and everything I leave a game it goes to a white screen and is stuck like that for a long time causing me to have to re install the App again but otherwise it's a fun game and u can make so many friends! Edit:Now my camera keeps getting locked at the back of my character causing the game for me to be annoying.,4
"I love this game. Recommend it. There are many different games such as obbies, tycoons, simulator games, etc! You can change your avatar into anything you can imagine but, with some robux. The only problem I really have is on mobile when you accidentally press the roblox icon in-game, and then press exit, it locks your screen meaning if you try to move your screen it just zooms in and out. I dislike we can't have multiple hairs anymore. Keep up the okay work, ROBLOX! 👍🏼",3
"This game overall is just a masterpiece. The gameplay is great, but I would give it 5 stars if it werent for the constant lag and glitches. One of these glitches in particular has spiked my interest and I have seen other people talk about it in their reviews for Roblox. The glitch is where icons like home and avatar, robux icons and so on are just blurry; so blurry in fact that you cant make out what button or icon that is. Another issue is the lag which places itself in many games. Thanks!!",4
I think that Roblox is a very good game but it sometimes bugs out like as of right now it's glitching and my phone is telling me that there is a bug when I try open the app. I gave it a four because it's a very entertaining game to play and I especially like to play bedwars as it's fun to play and with friends. I would've given it a 5 if they fix all the bugs and errors that occur. 😄,4
"I love this game, so overall; 5/stars! But i've had some issues with this. 1: I've been lagging a lot in the game, and no, it's not because of the graphics. 2: I have seen many Bugs whereever i go in the game. (Causes lag to me aswell) 3: When i play WCUE, it come's to the point where i cant move around a lot like i used to. 4: Apparently, the wau i've expirienced lag a lot, is because that my Laptop is not that old, i've had to sor like about, say- 3 Years. Im sorry if this turned into a rant!",5
"It's really good! But there is a problem. Bugs! (And laggyness ig) I'm on mobile with a new phone and this game keeps locking my screen. It also keeps automatically spinning when I go on pc. Back to mobile, it actually really just hates the screen or something. It automatically goes up on mobile. Also zooming in randomly on pc! I don't know what happened.",5
"I have a Dell Chromebook and it works but you have to choose your game online first because this app (the only one I could find for my computer) won't let you scroll through the games or any of your chats. However, after choosing my game online I can usually play no problem or with few, like certain buttons not matching up or the inability to scroll through tutorials.",4
"It is amazing how you include such various games and amazing entertainment, that too the cool animations that make it look more realistic and because of that I rate it a five star ... To make it even better try including more games with specific goals more characters and more ...adventure... From my opinion this is a good way to spend your pastime!",5
"I really love this game! But there is a problem. Whenever I make my Graphics Quality high, the speed becomes really slow. It happens all the time. Secondly, if I play a game for a lot of time, everything turns blurry and I have to rejoin. Thirdly, the game lags a lot. Even though my internet is stable and fine. Please fix those problems.",3
"This game is really nice it has lots of games that you can choose from, my only issue about this is app is the fact that sometimes you can't move or when you go to move the screen it lets you zoom in or out just by moving your finger it also sometimes it also kicks people off of Roblox and then it reloads I've had that happen to me a couple times but other than that it's a really good game but one last thing when I get kicked off or sometimes it says launching experience then it won't load.",5
"It was so fun to play games in it so many games. And one game became my favourite it was Brookhaven. There were many different types of games but one thing I didn't like was if we change our network then there get some issues in the games and because of that we have to leave the game and our changes don't get saved so we have to start all over. I hope you fix that issue. And, also some people tries to date. Like if I am playing someone will com and ask to me to date them.",4
"This app is very fun and cool. But I will say on mobile it tends to glitch a lot. Like, it freezes a lot more, the screen doesn't move but only zooms in and out, and it closes on its own. I've tested with 3 accounts and it does the same for all of them. Plus it's not updating so I can't play.",4
This game is a very fun & creative game. There are many games in one and you get to make your own avatar. The best part is that there arn't any annoying adds! I would put 5 stars but the game passes and items in the Item Shop can be very expensive. You can make a lot of new friend but the game has a friend limmit. Somtimes the game lags or even shuts down for a few days weather it's because of to many people on the game or bugs that need to be fixed. Sorry if you don't find this helpful.,4
"Roblox is a fun game where you can dress up as yourself or others, you can create and play games of your choice. Play with friends and strangers around the world. However, there is one bug that needs to be fixed, this bug effects the camera and when you're in the middle of playing the camera suddenly goes weird and you can only move certain ways. Ive seen and experienced this bug occur in multiple games, (such as: adopt me, tower of hell and mostly bloxburg!). However, roblox is a great game💕",4
"I've been playing for 3 years now and the experience is amazing! I even started a YouTube channel and it's pretty successful! Only a few problems. On my phone, I cant play anything anymore. Not even a simple base plate. I can't even see my avatar when I want to customize it. Roblox, if you can please fix these, it would make it way better ☺️",4
"Favourite game for years. The game play is really great, and it's overall a decent community. The only downfall I am very saddened with; is that removed the multi-hair when creating avatars. As a person who has a lot of fun messing around with avatars, this is a big issue... very sad. Other than that, It's safe, secure, and a great place to be in my free time",5
"I love this game!!!!! The more games everyone adds it gets more fun. You can interact with people and friends. There are so many realistic games. For the people who bother me the chance of seeing them again on another game is very rare, there were so many on my friends who I had lost touch with and I had found them on roblox and were were able to re connect. I absolutely love this game tho it might not be fitting for all, this is my opinion. I totally recommend getting this game!!",5
"Honestly, I think it's a pretty good game. The fact that it has lot's of mini games inside of it is just mind blowing! I really do think it deserves a perfect, good, encouraging solid 5 star rating!! Hope your plans go to plan and that you can be a successful, running app. All the luck, bye. Also when your playing it beware: There can be some toxic players.",5
"It's awesome. Has lots of great games and are very fun to play. The only things are that you get disconnected from games when your wifi is completely fine. And there should be more free stuff in the shop and stuff costs way too much robux. And lastly, games should be free to play. None should cost any money. But like I said before, great games and very good.",5
"I love this game!! I've been playing this for a years!But the problem is lag.Please fix the lags,if you do thank you!I still give this game rate 5 star!! will look more forward for this game!!Keep up a good workkk!!I freaking love it!!💕💞💫✨✨ Edit: Everything is still okay,but the lag is getting worst even when the screen got stuck and the screen moves around when the joystick moves too. Please fix that. I hope you did. Thank you.",4
"This game is really fun and it can distract you for hours. It has a lot of different and original games. Although, some are copyright and innapropriate which isn't helpful nor good for players 13 and under. The moderation is also really terrible and it needs to be upgraded because far too many people are getting let off with a warning when really it should be a permanent ban. Overall, roblox is a fun and inspiring game but it has some downfalls and dislikes.",5
"I love this game so much! The grafics are great, the way how you can make your own game is great. Best of all there are no adds at all! The one thing that doesnt really matter that I dont like is how theres max friends other then that its great. The one thing I would like Roblox to do is be able to delete peoples users that ask for personal information. For example I was playing with my friend in Brookhaven and this guy asked her age when she answered he left. Other then that its great try it!",5
"It's a good game but has bugs, etc. 1. The screen stops moving randomly, making you leave the game. (This is also frustrating while you're in the middle of a game) 2. The dynamic thumbstick sometimes moves the screen when you're moving it, so you have to change to another one and it's VERY annoying. 3. Roblox sometimes won't load on the first time I open it, so I have to close it and REOPEN it and then it works. 4. When I join a game, I have shiftlock on and cannot turn it off. (Only sometimes)",1
"Hello!! So roblox is a very nice game it's so fun and I could play it for hours, but there's one problem. The hair, it used to allow multiple hair(s) but now cause of the 3d clothing it's quite hard and complicated just to add 2 or 3 sets of hair. You now have to download the ""new"" and ""better"" roblox to have the hair and I still don't know how to do it so maybe try fixing it??",5
Execelent app. Amazing selection of games. Sometimes glitches happen which can be very annoying because you have to rejoin the game i hope you fix this. One time I tried to login but it wouldn't work so I had to create a new account. That was very annoying all my progress was lost.,3
"Okay, so this game is pretty good and addictive but the reason why I gave it as a 4 star review is that:- when you play any game it runs fine but then your camera gets stuck in one position! Which is really irritating and annoying. Second is that There is a issue that has been very annoying not just me but other players too.. it's the game like when you play some games it just runs fine and then it lags so much that it can even make you leave the game automatically like seriously?",4
"I've been playing this game for about 4 years now, I've had no problems with it, so, I put 4 stars because of the new clothing items, the 3d clothing. Now, I'm sure people love this update alot but when you search up shorts or pants, it doesn't even show any of the normal clothing, just 3d. I find this very annoying since rarely any people even use it and it makes it so much harder to find stuff. Other then 3d clothing, I love the game. Keep up the amazing work with your game!",4
"This is a poorly compressed and poorly optimized version of roblox for the phone. It's to the point where you can't play with any less then 3 gigs of ram. Don't even bother running this with a lower end phone. It'll die. Then again if you have a good phone, this app is great!",4
I would say that is is a very good game but on some platforms such as xbox the curser for some of the games are very hard to use so I would suggest that they should change that and it can be very lagy and some games you can not play on mobile so that for me if a big down fall. But apart from that the game is so good the graphics are just amazing.,5
"I love Roblox! I've been playing it for some time now.. But it I have a tiny problem. Most games I play it's so laggy! I have good internet. It kicks me out and I update my phone. It doesn't work. l tried and tried. It doesn't work. I hope you can fix the amount of lag. Otherwise it's a good game, and it has so many games. You can be creative.",4
"The game is dope, but there's alot of problems 1. whenever I join a random game it becomes portrait instead of landscape, I know there's an auto rotate but it's annoying for me 2. The screen keeps getting stuck, when I move the screen it just zoom in and zoom out Solution: I need to leave and join the game again but please fix that 3. The joystick gets glitchy, whenever I'm walking or running in a game it moves the screen when I'm moving the joystick. Please fix those problems for Phone players!",3
It's a good game but some times it just acts up alot. For example Bloxburg let's say you have a car and you get in the car it will just fling you around. And I don't like the fact it disconnects you from the game your playing it really gets annoying when your grinding. Plus when you get robux it will take a while and most of the girl hair is really expensive I really don't want to keep wasting my robux on buying new hairstyles and accessories. And now there are online dater.,4
Great Game! And there's a few things I want fixed sometimes in this game when you go to the menu to leave the experience accidently when you try to move your view of the game it zooms in and out and the only way to fix it is to rejoin so I would like that fixed otherwise it's a great game!,4
"I love this app and it used to a 5 star but I few issues now. One, updates come a little TOO often! Like when i'm least expecting it! Two, I feel it takes a little to much space, which may be a me problem, but still. Three, I feel like something needs to be done about the cross-platform play (I play on xbox and mobile). Otherwise its a great game and if you haven't you totally downloaded now.",4
"I like this game. I almost have 100 friends. The Hating issues is not good directions By frezzing (Mobile) And the Crash part, using mobile make a lot of glitches and, this game is a Online Game, PC/Laptop is way more helpful cause theres just a little bit of glitches. (100% Crash Part: Screen Freezed. Back Home with no Touching Home Button. Screen Blur And Freeze. Seperate Directions. Signal make moving slower and juming slower. (Mobile Issues)",5
We mobile users keep experiencing difficulties like when we touch the screen to look around it zooms instead so we have to rejoin the game. Also sometimes my joystick is moving like it has its own life so i need to go to menu to fix. One last thing whenever i play the da hood i zoom in and then if i click anywhere on screen it randomly zoom out so i can't even play the game. Please fix it asap! Thank you:D,3
the app is amazing. im able to play with all my friends and we have a blast. the only thing i do have a complaint about is the way my mouse works. you see im using a chromebook. when i use my mouse the icon will stop when it hits the edge of the screen and not got the entire 360 when in shift lock when i do hit the end of the screen my hot bar pops up. i would love to see this fixed so i can enjoy my experince even more. another issue i could say it shift lock not working alot of the games.,4
This game is so fantastic and super fun !! I really like it! But there's some problems... The games do glitch a lot but nice quality i'd say but the controls glitch alot!! You need to fix those if you can thanks. And the bugs. The zoom glitch when we zoom out with 2 hands it doesn't work but when 1 hands it does fix it Pls. Thank you for your help and hard working but I miss the old version I would say I mean i like the realistic things but no I miss the old versions. Thank you for your concern,2
A very well planned game that is very interactive with different topics from book readers to animie fans! And there's always room for more because the community is the ones that make the games so you always will find something you like! I only have one problem... safechat and it's not terrible it's just frustrating at times and if you would just make sure it doesn't block out words such as outside and fun and couple others it would be appreciated by many :) thanks!,5
"I play Roblox both on desktop and mobile. Desktop is perfect and all but on mobile, i often experience lots of bugs. Sometimes when I move my camera around, it switches it to zooming in or out of the pov. Also when I change my avatar, it randomly exits the app. Unneccessary tags on words are also one of my problems. Also whenI report someone itndoesn't really do much damage to them even though they deserve it. Hope they can fix this soon. Overall this is a great app.",3
"Great game on PC, absolute aids on Mobile (in most cases). Great amount of games with a vast variety of genres. The only complaint I have is the filter, sometimes words get tagged for no reason but most of the time the tags are appropriate. If you accidentally set your birth date wrong theres no changing it, even if you try getting customer support. Not a big deal but the filter is more exaggerated for >13 accounts.",4
"It's a amazing game! I've been never hacked before and I've just been enjoying the game even with the problem of sometimes my camera breaking it's not even a big deal I just rejoin and it's it's fine! I've played all platforms PC, Mobile, and Xbox! The controls are great! and lag isn't that big of a issue for me even though I have not the greatest device honestly overall it's an absolute masterpiece!",5
"Very good app! Although it's also sometimes gitchy, but it's very rarely and probably just my internet. This a good app to connect with friends, family, or people across the world! I also see alot of online dating, scamming, inappropriate clothing, pictures or games, and Bullying. But anyone can easily report that. I'd definitely recommend this app!",5
"The experience on pc is very good, but on mobile, no. Not so much. There are bugs after bugs with the UI. I wasn't even 3 seconds into a game and I couldn't move my camera. This gltich frustrates me. Second glitch, sometimes moving the thumbstick also moves the camera. It only happens with the new thumbstick, so I'll just switch the thumbstick to the classic one, but guess what? It has a glitch as well! It sometimes freezes and then I continue to move to the direction of the thumbstick! bruh.",3
"Roblox is a great game although there are a few downfalls- it takes up a lot of storage and is quite laggy on mobile. Also on Xbox you simply cannot chat no matter how much you alter your settings, and certain games you cannot access on Xbox. Those two things need to be addressed but other than that I love everything else.",4
"It is a great game. But at times my screen would glitch out and I would not be able to move forward only my screen,Now that is SUPER ANNOYING! And how much robux costs is also annoying that is why so many people don't like it. Overall it is a great game though fix those mistakes and it will be better.",3
"I really love this app, there are SO MANY games to choose from! The reason for four stars is because of the only thing I don't like about this game: the reconnections. Whenever your internet cuts out, it doesn't even give you a chance to wait for it to come back and continue playing. You always have to click the reconnect button and then it puts you into a different server. If there was any way to fix this, this app would be perfect. Otherwise, really great app!!!",4
"Roblox is a great game with a thousands of worlds but I found some problems, like, if you are having a lot of memory in a world, it lags a lot and, sometimes when I start the app, it doesn't even let me in and last that, when I was costomizing my skin and I saved it, the next day I was not able to see that skin. So if Roblox is able to fix those bugs, I will be appreciated. But overall It's a great game with good graphics and buietiful worlds.",4
Its amazing and ive played it for years. I just have one thing. Im on computer so whenever I join a game I have to adjust so when people first start would you add like a question how they like it if they are on computers? It would be really helpful to all computer players. IOS players just swipe but computer players have to press i adjust then press o just to adjust. That is all I ask so if you could add that that would be amazing! Thank you! Also if you cant add it its alright. Thanks again!:),5
"Yes!!! You guys fixed the glitch!!! Now my friends list is now where it is at and my game progress has been set back to where it was. Now it's the amazing game it used to be. Good job creators! The game is running smoothly again. With millions of games, great character customisation and you can hang with friends, perfection.",5
"I love Roblox so much! I give Roblox a 5 star because it is my favorite game and it is so cool! You can do anything in it. But there are some problems. It is a tiny bit laggy on the computer. And the graphics could be way better. For ex. I'm in a game & I try to look far away but it won't let me because the graphics are just that bad. People can dress very innappropiatlly, and people can just be very mean, not all people though. But still you should get it! Its amazing and you won't regret it!",5
The game is good but one thing that needs to be fixed when your in mobile. 1. The game will zoom in instead of looking around. Reason: When you press the screen alot of times. Solution: I need to leave the game and join back. 2.When you control the joystick it will make the game look around while your moving. i dont know the reason why it happens Solution: Rejoin the game or change your joystick in the settings classic.,4
"Best game bruh :D. One problem though. I've gotten robux a few times before, but Everytime I make a purchase it says, 'This purchase has not been completed'. I've switched devices, restarted my device, but it still did the same thing. Please fix this. I will report this to the maintenance. Thanks! :D ( keep on adding updates, the game is really good!)",5
This game is really enjoyable and adventurous aswell as exciting however there are a few very minor problems though. Some players could be bius on servers but that's very rare. The main thing is that some times when ever I go on severs my camera view is messed up and when I go on to camera settings it's exactly the same as usual but on the server it is still messed up. Other than that this game is very fascinating and joyous and I love playing it :),5
"This experience is just great. I love the way people from all around the world can interact with eachother and form friendships. Voice chat is also great, hence you can find out a bit more about people and not only see tags all the time! And the layered clothing is amazing, you may not be able to use it in some games, but in most it's there! One thing that bugs me is that you cannot have any more than 200 friends. But still a really good game!",5
"i love the game its so 🤩 but there's 2 things the is so wrong 1. Sometimes when i go to pause the game then resume it, it just my view won't move at all. It's like stuck there then when i try to move my view, instead of moving it will zoom in. So i have to leave the experience and go to another one 2. Sometimes when I try to play an experience there's a notice the said ""same account lunched Etc."". But I don't have a same account as my account I rate this 4/5. i still Love this game",4
"Love this game! The problems are moderation and bugs. When people don't follow rules, they don't even get banned! Second, bugs. Sometimes when I play the game my screen turns to all squares when I move. And it sometimes dosen't let me walk. Please fix these problems.",3
"I've been playing since 2018 on mobile and it's been pretty good until these couple of months, everytime i try to join a game it either exits out and goes back to the main loading screen or just straight up exit out of the app, even after several tries i still couldn't join a game. Still deciding wether if it's because of my wifi, phone or the app. I just want to be able to play properly again.",3
"It's a really great app but please get rid of the inappropriate games. And there's two bugs on mobile. 1. The shiftlock glitch. When I'm in first person then I leave, I get the glitch. So far the only thing to fix it is by going to a game that has the shiftlock button and spamming the button. Then leaving the game. 2. The screen glitch. You get this when you are walking, then you accidentally press the menu button. The only way to fix this was by leaving or another way without leaving the game.",3
"This app is really fun but there are quite a few bugs like sometimes when I'm role-playing on my tablet and I move the control stick it moves my screen instead and I have to get out of the game and go back in pls fix if possible. Also there is a certain bug on a certain game that I'd really like to be fixed, in Warrior Cats: Forest Territory, if you jump sometimes it pulls you back a long way away this is something that I'd REALLY like to be fixed if possible, thank you!",4
"ROBLOX always works and I know that it is a reliable app. It's very fun to play video games on it, such as Adopt Me! and Fashion Famous. I find new games every day and I love to play it! Although, when I go on my Chromebook to play Roblox, the connection is much slower than a MacBook. I feel this should be fixed. My friend and I were playing in the same room, and hers still loaded faster than me with the same internet.",5
"Great app. Love using and trying out all the different kinds of games and obbies. Very fun and time-consuming. One thing I would like to fix, is the fact that it costs Robux to make your own club. I do not have Robux. Otherwise, beautiful app with good gameplay. Two thumbs up! 👍👍 (Graphics could use improvement)",5
"Just to report this because it is annoying, I got 3 reasons, reason number 1, if you click like 3 or 4 clicks per second or getting lag, your screen won't work, instead it zooms in or zooms out, reason number 2, whenever you try to play a game that has too much graphics, it just kicks you if you are really laggy, half of the mobile players are experiencing this and it is getting them mad, and the reason number 3, if you try to use the 3d layered clothing in R6, it wouldn't work except on r15...",2
I love roblox! And all the games too!! Mostly I just play warrior cats and it's went from the first version to the NEXT LEVEL!! The graphics are amazing and the fact you can pick things up too! But there's also one thing that's a problem for me..the things that you have to but are so expensive and the fact that you have to buy stuff...uhhhh yeah it's kinda annoying but everything else I really like! Keep up the good work!!! 👍 👌💞💕💗,5
Sooooooo fun! No ads and I love playing online and making friends ( my favourite is Brookhaven) the only thing wrong is that you have to pay money for robux it would be better if you could earn robux doing tasks or something. I also need to update it every week and it gets really annoying it doesnt even fix all the bugs i have! >:( still it's a good game :3,5
"I've always loved roblox, it's a very fun game with endless possibilities. Although I have experienced a few bugs. Every time I try to join my royale high private server, it days I don't have permission to join it. The only thing that'll fix it is uninstalling and reinstalling the app and signing in again, and even when I do that, it only works for a max of 4-5 days. Please please PLEASE fix this bug, it's been bugging me for WEEKS!",4
Roblox have been one of the best games I have ever played! But. There are a few problems. 1st getting out of the game only in my tablet. 2nd when I go in settings. And after getting out from the settings the direction I'm walking in my camera turns that way. 3rd Outfits blurred. For a alot of time in almost every game. It has happened to many other people. I'm pretty sure it only happens on tablets. And I would appreciate it alot if Roblox fixed these bugs.,5
"I love this game! This is so fun that you can play with ur friends but it's also still fun even without friends- But there is a few bugs for me :( Whenever I click the Roblox logo to add friend someone or accidentally click it,the screen camera randomly is just zooming me in and out and I can't move it around.Only my character tho and I have to rejoin in order to play the game properly. (This happens sometimes and it annoys me.) Pls fix this and I would like that this doesn't happenToOthersToo..",5
I have been playing this game for two years now I've lost my account in 2020 but now I have another account. For some reason I've also got my jumping button frozen but I just push leave game then the jumping stops. Like a lot of people say that there camera freezes that may happen because you pinch the screen to much. I reccomend this game. Very well made also the people made this very nicely the graphics are very good!,5
"Great to pass time. No need to spend money if you don't want but you can. My son is 6 daughter 11 and I'm 35. Games for everybody! (Edit) Been a couple years of playing now and I'm more inclined to play now than ever. Soooo many games now. The ability to make your own is intriguing, although I recommend a version that is free for non spenders. Very few problems with Roblox itself. Very quick to fix any that come about. Very safe for your Yong children as it is very well regulated.",5
"Good game, although I have 1 suggestion and 1 problem, Suggestion: could you add more free clothes or accessories, the store is very limited when it comes to free products and most items are paid which could be unfair for people who can't afford robuxes to buy accessories or clothes, so if possible to add free clothes and accessories like the other free stuff in store. Problem: whenever I go to menu, the camera glitches which the view could only be controlled with the movement controls.",4
"I love this game especially the horror and the simulator games.But there are a few problems tho like when I'm playing a game and I'm about to walk my screen starts to move like crazy. Another problem is whenever I'm playing a game it kicks me out for no reason making me restart the whole game. It also disconnects me from most of the games I was gonna play even tho my wifi is at full bars. If you guys could fix these bugs please do, it would be nice. But overall it's a good game.",4
"It's a great game. There are some issues though, like when u click on a game and it's laggy. Take Warrior cats for example, even when I have good service, it's still laggy. And another thing that bugs me is when u have to buy the robux instead of earn them. Other that that it's a good game, I would recommend this game to anyone.",5
"Would've been perfect but the bugs just sux, when you are walking and you tap the menu, the screen will suddenly follow your joystick, and when you are moving your screen and tap the menu, the screen wont turn which will ruij the experience for when you are having fun with random, there's alot of mobile bugs hut currently this is the major bug for mobile, fix it and most people will be happy and youll rise more.",4
It's a great game but there is two problems. One the camera glitch. It's so annoying the only way to solve the problem is to leave Roblox then rejoin. Two when I leave adopt me the screen freezes completely and I try to swipe down in the game but it won't let me. Please fix this bug.,4
"Its a really good app! I just have a problem that has tainted my game for about 2 years now, when I play a game that I haven't played for roughly a week to a month, it freezes while sound moves on, this doesn't happen on computer leading me to play most of these games on there, but since I mostly play on mobile I don't know how to do things I would normally, breaking my gameplay experience. I'm now contemplating un-installing the app forever or getting a new phone, which both are incredibly bad.",3
"Design is fine, games are mostly great while some either don't last long or depend on what type of game you play, if not interested the game wouldn't try to be apealling which could be why some people find roblox boring. theres also a bug with the camera. When you swipe the camera instead of the camera moving, it zooms out/in, this bug occurs way too often that its getting annoying. Ping spikes have been occuring way too often lately too. Hope they fix it",3
"Everytime I play a game, it always shuts down and restart the app. I also can't join my friends when I click their profile. And the whenever the game lags, the screen glitches making it unable to rotate. I would give this a 5 star but there are a lot of bugs that needs to be fixed.",3
"I love roblox, but it glitches ALOT and recently it has started to kick me out of games, and close the app. And it is very annoying when you are just having a normal conversation, and and then you type something, but the word turns into #### (hashtags). This is very annoying, and it happens to the simplest of words, like the, or, ok, go, yes, etc. I would give it five stars, but these problems are very annoying. Please fix. -_-",4
"It can be slow a little bit for some devices so i prefer to play on computer(PC)and not my phone. There are over 1000 games that you can play. Bloxburg is the only game i found that costs robux but only 25. Its a good price for a game that good. And the fact i can meet new people and then add to my friends list makes me happy i can play with them again. The reason I'm putting 4 stars is because when I go to update it I keep getting the notification that it can't update, so I can't play the game.",4
"I think this game is amazing and fun. There are so many things to do, but one bug is that when I went to certain games I could play for a minute then my screen would go black but i could still hear the music from the game, I would have to wait for 20 minutes to get it to work again. I this bug could be fix I would be thankful. But overall it is a fun game to play.",5
"My experience in Roblox has been brilliant! I've been playing for 3 years and I'm pretty sure I never quitted it for a while. This game is definitely a recommendation for people who love making friends and just to enjoy fun! Many games have great graphics and there are so many ones to choose from! From baking games to roleplays and story games, surely you will love this!",5
"its really good! acceptable for kids of all ages. lots of different games for you too explore, you can role-play, build or even climb into a world of adventures! If you were too ask me id definatekly say yes too downloading it. ive been playing this game for 2 years now and it hasnt let me down, not once!",5
I like this game the most but there is some problems 1. sometimes when I join pet simulator X it doesn't let me join. 2. The rotation screen just only have big small all over again 3. When I pressed the jump button for too long it will infinitely jump until I need to leave and join back. If you fix these problems I will give this game a five star 🌟.,4
"The game is amazing! Ive been playing sence 2017-2018 and there has been no problem. Even though the game crashes sometimes and doesnt load, it is still a great game. But the reason i gave 4 stars is because there is a glitch, im not sure this only occurs for me or anyone else but the ""gear"" youre able to buy is not loading im games. Ive restarted the app many times and it still doesnt load in game. Hoping you could fix this?! Thank you!",4
"This Game is pretty cool, got a lot of different game types for almost all Ages. And it has some cute games with pets, I like the pet ones mostly. I do wish that they would add an ""appear offline"" feature, it's great to play with your friends but sometimes you wanna have a quiet moment and go collect those cute pets alone sometimes. Thank about that :) Also, please respect the young ones playing out there! Some love Roblox to the fullest!",5
"Wow I love it. I have been playing it since late 2017s, and never have experienced any technicals before, but nowadays, it has a LOT of problems. the game suddenly crashes and returns to home screen and/or loading screen when i try to play games on it or try to open the app on mobile, but not on pc. On my desktop computer, it works fine... I really hope you could fix this, its my favorite app:((",3
"Great game, you have so many different games its nearly endless but there are bugs and I have really good wifi but it hasn't been loading games much so some I can't play and for some reason if I play like 20 minutes it kicks me most of the time less than that i don't know what the problem is with that but overall I think it's a very good game I would recommend atleast trying it!",4
I really like this game and I really recommend playing this app but there are several glitches like the camera glitch where you can't move your camera and you have to leave and join back to fix it. Roblox has has many updates with bug fixes but they aren't fixing the most important ones. (Only happens on moblie) but somehow the game isn't bad because of it its actually really good and you should try it!!,5
"Great game. I love how it has something for everyone. (Mystery, Parkour, roleplay, etc). The games graphics are good aswell as the hair and clothing selection. Great way to make friends or to play with your own. Despite all these good attributes, it does have to cons. Like the constant updates, or the fact that if you don't have robux(which costs money) theres no way you could actually enjoy the game, or the excessive amount of hackers, scammers, trolls, and bugs-for a childens game.",4
"This game is very fun, but one little problem anytime when you put your device on your bed on the screen part, the screen gets messed up it just locks up one place even when you try to move it, overall in some games when this issue happens it stops, i dont know how to explain it but yea, pretty good game. Ive also been playing since 2019",5
"I mean, this game is really good, but I dont like the fact that you need really good wifi for the games to function properly. I am 2 rooms away from the router and roblox doesnt open. It also makes other players lag a lot, and adds a bunch of unnecessary bugs into the game. Even 2.4g network isnt good enough. So I have to play on a chair next to the router, connected to 5g network! Pls fix this. Otherwise, roblox is a wonderful game! 💜",4
"Sometimes scammers can be annoying but that's only if you play adopt me. My favorite game is Bloxburg. But it does cost 25 robux. If you use $10.00 u can get 800 tobux. But you have to purchase the card at the store. You can purchase it online, but it might be a little bit more difficult. That's my opinion hope it helps. Also if you choose to download the game just know it's really fun (you probably already know but there aren't any adds on roblox.) Lastly, I hope you have a great experience!!!",5
"I always play this, however, there are some bugs I have been experiencing. Those bugs include very oridinary things such as the website not loading, and a couple others I forget. Excluding that, this game is perfect! Keep up the great updates!",5
"It's an amazing game. So many games to play in so many catagories. The robux only cost to 48 cents or 5 dollars, it's very cheap. But, when my Internet is running just fine, it says disconnected. It's probably just a me problem, but still. IT'S AN AWESOME GAME. Also, HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!",5
"So, first things first. The Roblox updates are MASSIVE. I'm playing on mobile and every time I update, I have to delete like seven games for it to work, and not only that, I'll delete games and it starts to download, but then tells me I need to delete MORE. Because of this, I've deleted my entire phone gallery just to update this game. Second, what's up with the camera randomly locking up on mobile? It's horrid. This game is overall great but still has massive problems that need to be resolved.",3
"It is the best the whole fact that you can play with your friends but you can play millions of games and you can buy robux and get cool items for your avatar, items in games and you can also get promo codes it's just so fun and my favourite game is probably adopt me. But on the downside is that people are always being mean to each other wich I think should stop. And there are some bugs and glitches that the owners should properly fix because it's getting realy annoying. THANK YOU!",5
"It's a really amazing game! It's okay for younger kids and roblox lets you use your imagination. It's really fun and some games you can create your very own magnificent creative land! It's no fiddly or anything it's quite easy. AND 80 robux is only 99p. And best of all, there's a TON of games! It's one big block with millions of spectacular, fascinating games to play. But, I couldn't give it a 5 star because sometimes it spins your screen or doesn't allow you to jump. Please update this.",4
"The app is REALLY FUN, but it upgrades soooooo much! I don't want to upgrade it as much as I do; it's very laggy, especially when you are on samsung mobile. (That is from experience, and I think a lot of people will agree. But I can't play it on my new laptop because it updated to something im not up to yet. ={",4
"Best game because it has no adds but a problem is that whenever you open settings and close settings super fast at a game sometimes the screen would be stuck at the worst positon and when you try moving screen it sometimes not move and sometimes zooms out and in so please fix this bug so peple can make their life happy and great, and i dont know if a computer ipad could let you make your games. So please tell us, And we need more people to download this game, i rated five out of five :))))))))",5
"I love Roblox, it's super fun and has a lot to do, and I just got back on like a week or so ago, but my games keep crashing. It wouldn't let me on games that had to teleport, and it's annoying. I was able to get into Royale High, but literally 5 seconds in it crashes. And I have good connection. Please fix this.",4
"It's a great game and all, but we have some problems. 1) The screen glitches every time I load in an iPad/Tablet but when I join from a computer/laptop it's completely normal! 2) Sometimes, when I purchase anything from the Avatar Shop, it gets deleted the second I buy it and I am not able to get a refund. And when I DO, it just gives me a percentage, like if I buy something with 50 robux and refund it, I will get 15 robux back! 🙁 Hope you can fix this bug please! 💕",4
Glitch glitch glitch glitch crash crash crash crash. it's all the same thing my game either just glitches out and forces me to leave the game and rejoin or I just crash entirely. I've heard about how the code on Roblox is old but I'm getting to the point where I wouldn't care if the game would have to shut down for a whole month just fix it! besides that really good game.,4
I love the game its my favourite game but I have a few issues with the game. 1) I keep disconnecting and I check my WiFi works fine and it's super annoying when it's a game what doesn't save your progress. 2) my camera sometimes doesn't turn and I have to rejoin the game to make it work again. Overall a fun game!,5
"This is my childhood game i play it all the time. But it has quite a lot of limits. I have seen the new hairstyles, they look great but not when you wear them. I would love if they looked like the picture. Most things cost robux, but other than that bugs for me are getting lesser which is great. Keep up the great work",5
"It's a good app it has lots of games in it but the problem is the camera, sometimes the camera just like it not moving anymore only the character it's annoying cause you'll have to rejoin and sometimes your camera will be not moving again it's so annoying,plus when I'm literally close to our wifi it just says 'Disconected' like what?!? I'm literally next to the wifi it's just annoying!,Please Fix this if you can thank you.",3
"The game is amazing but I do have a problem. When playing in tablet mode on my computer, my screen will suddenly stop. When I start moving again my screen moves along with my thumbstick. This mostly happens when I open the player menu. Another thing is that my screen will stop and when I start moving again and try to turn the camera, my screen zooms in and out again.",4
I absolutely love this game. It allows your imagination to run wild with so many adventures ahead to look forward to. It can however be a bit frustrating with some glitches but im sure the roblox team will be able to sort it out. I would highly recommend this game to anyone with an open mind to new exploring and adventures. (Also be sure to follow roblox on Twitter as they give you a little insight on new games and updates coming up!),5
"There’s a bug with the camera when u swipe the screen the camera is not going to the left/right but it will zoom in/out. Also when u move the joystick the camera will also move following the joystick, I don't know how to explain it but I will send a record video about it to your emails. I hope you guys can fix this because it’s very annoying for mobile user. Thank you. :(",4
"So far, I've enjoyed the mobile version of Roblox. However, the problem that I've encountered so far was the difficulty in pressing the jump button. Even though I press the jump, my character does not jump. It sometimes glitches, making the character jump non-stop even though you stopped pressing the jump button. Hope this problem would be fixed.",4
"This is a very fun game, including the millions of games on it. Yet on thing bothers, me. Actually quite a few things do. Whenever im playing it doesn't let me move, until my screen turns black. I can move, but I can't see where im going. Thats it, I hope you can fix these bugs/glitches!",4
"The games are fun to play and there are a ton of them, but the games always lag even if you have wifi. And it always has updates that you have to wait for. They are so annoying! It's fun to play with friends when you can but also a lot of games say they are one thing but aren't and a lot of games are either the same thing as another one or even more boring and shorter!",3
I love playing on my free time! I never get bored considering the fact that there is billions of games to choose from. I don't really like the updates because they take a very long time. Also for everyone who plays on mobile try playing on pc because it doesn't glitch or crash if your pc isn't old and you're updating roblox when it's needed to be updated.,5
"I love really love the games, people, and how you rlly get to hangout/chat with them! It's rlly fun making friends and communicating with the people and stuff, but I have been having a little problem with the games settings. In my pc when I click acc info, security, privacy, notifs etc. It hasnt been loading and I have been waiting for almost an hour but hasn't been loading. Pls fix this!! -Update The loading problem is now fixed btw! Thank you! It's now loading properly.",5
"A great game, but the only problem is lag. My phone has 8GB RAM and always has at least 3GB of RAM free at all times. At most, this game takes 1.5 GB of RAM. My internet is great, and my phone is great. The in-game quality settings do not reduce lag by any more than +-2fps when going from one extreme to the other (highest setting to lowest and vice-versa.) This lag is just as bad no matter what game I play in Roblox.",4
Very entertaining various genres to pick and choose to play. Fun for many age groups. I'm a whole adult here enjoying the game. Good job 👏🏽 👍🏽 a few bugs here and there I've only gotten kicked from the fame once where I was unable to reconnect but overall great experience. Also cross platforms so I swap from mobile to console exactly where I was no lost progress etc. Go check it out you won't be disappointed.,5
"This game is so different compared to others in my opinion, like there are hundreds of game here and it's just amazing and so fun, tho I give a 4 star since sometimes there are little bugs and glitches. Such as that short hair bug, not sure why but whenever(my avatar is a girl) I chose short hair style it never appears in any game I join, but the other hairstyles do. But other then this, roblox is very unique I must say 😁",4
"So fun, lots of games to choose from. Also I love that you can customize your avatar, and find people to play with! you can also make your own game! The only thing i don't like about this game is that in my personal opinion robux should be given to you for beating games and getting badges cause it's pretty expensive otherwise. They should also bring tiks back.",4
"Very very frustrating. It keeps kicking me out of the app everytime I try to run the app. Once I try to play, it freezes then the app crashes again. I tried uninstalling it ang installing it again but it still does not get fixed. Please fix this problem. I'm a solid fan of this game. now I don't know if I still like the app.",2
"I LOVE this app it is truly amazing! The only thing is (not sure if it's the company or just my phone) when I try to enter adopt me, it loads but then turn into a blue screen and I've restarted my phone, reset the character, left and rejoined multiple times, it's starting to feel hopeless😔 and adopt me is by far my favorite game! What should I do? (EDIT) 5 STARS!! sorry it was my phone!! The app is wonderful and no complaints!👌🏻",5
"It is a great game and I have forged bigger bonds with my friends by playing this 😊 although I like the style emo and when I was deciding my avatar fit, I realised they stopped hair combos. Please bring them back!! 🙏🏼 otherwise, the best game ever. Also, I'm not sure about the music deal but some people are managing to play inappropriate songs. How? Also, the chat filter. I know you are trying to protect other kids from bad language, but some of us can barely speak. You really must fix this.",4
"In my opinion roblox is a great game really, it has its pros and cons, but there's to many cons in my belief. On xbox you cant chat in game which I think should be added, and there's are too many error codes for xbox aswell, it would be great if they added chat options on xbox and if they fixed the errors, but overall roblox is a great game, but I think it needs more fixes.",4
"Im a HUGE fan of roblox, I love how its a massive multy-player game because you get to make new friends, you get to check out other people's games, you can play with your friends on other friend's or people's games, and so on. But, some people acn betray you. So, only friend people you can trust. Other than that, the game is made for about 3+. Most of the time it would lag out and crashed, this has been happening for longer than a month and Roblox Studios never fixed it. Other than that 5 stars.",5
"Great game! Started playing in 2015 and have loved it ever since! I do have one minor issue currently, when trying to sign in on my chromebook the verification barrier is very buggy and after completeing it, it won't let me sign in and says there was an issue.",4
"Yes, a very fun game overall. Just that for somereason it thinks im playing on a phone sometimes even though im on a laptop, specificaly a chromebook. Also on a chromebook cursor doesn't stay in the center when in first person, it just moves across the screen and makes it really hard to play. If there is a few things to fix it would be that. 5/5 otherwise.",5
"Roblox is so fun to play and it's really addictive but I found a problem a few hours ago. Because when I try to open the app, it just automatically closes. I tried restarting and reopening the app a lot of times but it still won't work. Same with the Roblox in my laptop. It will open but it can't play games and my avatar won't load. Can you please fix these issues so I can play and have fun again... Thank you in advance!!",3
"This game I really fun, I love how it works, I played it since 2015, I would like if you fix this bug, first of all. It's always lagging on mobile, also when I leave it just for 5 minutes, my walks switch froze and when I tried to walk my character, is not the switch walks but the zoom who getting touch. My screen are actually are little blur. Please fix these, I hope you understand, Roblox.",5
"Game is great, great quality, it just freezes at times. And glitches sometimes for no reason even when you have a good device. Other then that, game is super fun, there's all types of genres in games, and it's just super fun but I did wish you could earn robux instead of buying them",4
"Fun. But laggy👁️3👁️. It's like a whole bunch of games in one. You can customise your avatar and everything. Only one problem. Theres a bug that needs to be fixed immediately. It's where you just cant rotate your screen. It happens randomly, like, you can still walk but you can't tilt your screen. Hoped this review helped! 💗",5
"Great but issues in mobile with stuff not appearing in inventory, moving and zooming out/in (after resuming the game or trying fix graphics, volume/control etc) when u tried to move around problem. Getting disconnected/kicked even if my wifi is great and no problem. Overalls is nice imo I don't really have a problem because my goal is just to have fun in games I choose to play.",4
This is a really fun game I'll say that. But one thing I'll say that annoys me is that if your on mobile and you accidentally press the tabs button on your phone the game controls glitch like the movment mode moves the screen or the screen movement makes it size your screen and its very annoying. Please fix it.,4
"Love this game, love the friends I've made on it, overall good game but if you have a low-end device I would not suggest it. However, as much as I love this game I often have problems with the joystick and the camera. Sometimes I move the joystick and it moves the entire camera. Also, sometimes I can't move the camera whatsoever. I can only zoom in or out and the only way to fix it is by leaving. This has happened to 2 of my devices that I play Roblox on and it's really frustrating.",4
"It's a great app , but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because , Sometimes, my screen lag/glitch alot while playing games , or isn't able to move.. and that mostly happens when I click my menu and turn it off.. and i think roblox should modified scammers in avatar , or doesn't allow to use them such same image as the original one.. that's all , over-all it's a good app , i recommend you to atleast give a try",3
"joystick/movement complaint since my computer broke i started playing on my phone but i hate one glitch that is happening on phone; im playing but then randomly my screen locked and can only zoom and cant even walk this glitch is really annoying since you have to re join the game or you wont be able to do anything than zoom , otherwise the game is great! Would reccomend playing on pc its more detailed and had no bugs. (kinda unfair) Thanks for reading have a great day.",3
"I chosse a five this app, it is great but some times it gets laggy, for example it kicks you off certain games. It doesn't on computer, PC, chrome books and ext... But overall it is an amazing game and I don't see why I shouldn't give it a five! I really recommend it, because you can't get it on one device you can get it on all!😊",5
"The game is good! It has a customization system, millions of playable games, tons of friendly players. But im not here to talk nice about it. BUG 1. The Camera bug, when you swipe or tap your screen too much, it gives you the Camera Bug. (Details) ""Makes the Android/ios device screen only, use ""zooming in and zooming out"" PROBLEM 1. Removing audio is the number 1 thing, people are complaining about. (Details) ""Removed all audio"". That one simple problem irritated the whole platform in everyone.",3
"It is super fun and nice.. You can make friends but there's a few problems with this game. There is online dating players, hackers, bullies... Sometimes my camera freezes and sometimes it glitches. But overall, this is a super fun game. You can play with friends and others.. I also forgot about kidnappers... They ask where you live or something and they do something bad to you. But that's all! Good game!",4
"its a good game and all but theres this one thing that really annoys the heck out of me, and its the joystick bug, whenever i experience freeze touch, the joystick will always bug out causing my movement to be glitchy, sometimes i wouldnt even be able to move around. i would greatly appreciate it if you would fix this bug because ive been waiting patiently for this bug to be fixed.",3
"Very good Tho it has a couple hacker but still fun. Update: It has been very good, it's just in some games there are hackers and that's not fun. It also has a problem for mobile players, the jump button always seems to not work and pause and you can't jump even if you press on it sometimes. But other than that it's pretty good.",5
"Its very fun, one thing is that it does sometines take a while to enter certain games... Another problem I've been getting is that I'll have to reconnect and then reconnect again and then it will kick me out of the game, pr sometimes the app... Also it will sometimes randomly kick me out of the game im playing... But thats prety much allll, great game...super fun!!",5
"I love this game! the problem is, the Robux.. I don't want it to be like a dollar it is too costly for me i want it to be a little less.otherwise it's a great game! But it would be cool if u can add colours option for the shirt and all.That would be cool just giving some information on how to make the game better but it's also good.",5
"This game is pretty great! You can play stuff like Natural Disaster Survival, fall down stairs and other random games, there are ALL types of games on this cool app! But theres a few issues (on my touchscreen chromebook) Firstly, whenever I move my camera on my keyboard, It only zooms in and out so I have to use the arrows, Second it often kicks me out when I try joining, and Third is lagging, even if I have full bars on wifi. But its still a super fun game! Anyways I recommend playing roblox!",4
"This game is the best, it is a little slow on my chromebook, and I also for some reason cant load into Adopt Me. Im always really laggy, and it slows my whole computer down. When I try to get into Roblox sometimes it says that I dont have any internet when I have full bars. Its weird, but I still love this game with all my heart. If you could fix these issues that would be greatly appreciated!",5
LOVE THE GAME or should I say games? Well anyway it's very good and I highly recommend but one of the bugs that I hate is if you accidentally put 3 fingers on the screen it does this annoying bug where it makes ur screen zoom out and in if you try to look around and it's so annoying and hard to play that I have to rejoin the game but otherwise roblox is one of my favourite games just please fix this bug but thank you!! <33,5
"Everyone is so dumb the reason why your screen turned blurry is because your phone/tablet/laptop/PC is too trash that it crashes, and the jumping bug is just a small thing u shouldn't complain plus you could still fix that by pressing the Roblox logo that's on the top left corner of your screen, you should be more worried about bugs like the ones where your screen can't move and you have to rejoin.. people these days are so dramatic",5
The games are awesome but recently I seem to have been having a lot of trouble teleporting into games and the lag is horrible in some of the games. I also keep trying to join some of the games and it says my account is already on it? But when I try other games it just let's me play. Overall it's a really great game but some of the bugs are really irritating!!,3
"This is a great game that i totally recommend. I have been playing this for about 6 years, and I'm now having issues. Everytime i go to login it gives me a 2 step verification code. The code is sent to my email and once i go to put it in, it starts loading but never loads.",4
"Excellent game, and you have such a variety to choose from. However, when playing on a Samsung Tablet, the app shuts down randomly. And when playing on a laptop, it freezes all of the time. Other than that, amazing game and would highly recommend.",4
This is an okay app but the worst thing about is that whenever I play in my tab it closes every 1 min automatically which VERY annoying. One of my favourite tycoon game does not save any progress so when it closes every 1 min it's really annoying. If you don't fix this in the next update THEN I will never install this app and won't recommend it to my friends either,2
"This game is really fun and easy to learn how to controll it. It is good because you have more than one option of games to choose from. You get to chat with friends and play online games with them. There are war games like bed wars, war tycoons. war simulates, tower battle, and more! There are also Role play games like Brookhaven, Adopt me, Livetopia, Bloxburg etc. Theres tycoons, simulaters, (speed runs speed runs are kindy hard for beginners) obbies,there is also hide and seek, and lots more!!",5
It's a it's a good game but there's still one bug in the bug is where sometimes when you're in the middle of a game you just get stuck and you can't move and when you try to move your camera and go like all the way up out of the map and in the map in your first person and it's so annoying so I'm leaving 4 stars until that's fixed,4
"I love it. But sometimes while I play the game, my camera will ocassionly get stuck and I will only be able to zoom in or out but cant move it. Please fix this bug because it happens often to me, I will give you 5 stars if you fix it, other than that great game! Would recommend to people who like multiplayer and entertaining games!",4
"Love the game but there are a few bugs that really drive me and my toddler nuts. Sometimes I respawn and can't walk forward, but I can grapple hook across the screen. Often in mid game the camera gets stuck in one angle and the only way to fix it is to exit fully and restart the game app and lose progress.",4
"Roblox is updating a lot, and I just updated my roblox app last week and I have to update it again. This is starting to become anoying, beacuse sometimes my wifi works slow. That is not even all the problems with playing on a chromebook. Roblox does not let me get out of game when I try to get out of the game. It is really annoying please fix these problems!",2
"This game is Very Entertaining and Enjoyable! There are a lot of games you can play of your choice! On Computer I have No problem of playing any game I want but on phone it is Not really easy to play with on phone,I mean on some phones it is perfect but on the other hand in some phones there are a lot of Glitches and some times it even kicks you out! Please fix this bug!",4
"😁My experience with roblox has been amazing sure it might be down or glitching some times but it's good. I sometimes have trouble playing royale high because my screen turns black the back to normal consistently. I hope other people get an amazing experience from roblox because it can be amazing once you start playing. By the way I would recommend bloxburg, bedwars, and story games they're a lot of fun. Have a good day. 👍 😁",5
Don't get me wrong I love this game but when I play some games the game froze and it's not one game. not only that there is a about 30% chance that if you walk/run when moving the screen it will start zooming you in or out (dependent) and sometimes if you walk/run the screen will move there he used to be a fix that sometimes worked it was going to the menu button in the upper left corner and swiping back and forth in between the lines of two players but after like two updates that stoped. Fix it,4
"The best online game!! The video description is what actually the game is inside unlike those other ad from other games. You can make friends,play with friends,have fun and do whatever you want because there are a lot of games that you can choose! I recommend this game for everyone above 8 or 9 because some people swear but in total,it's really good😁👍",5
"Very good game! But theres 4 problems/bug, 1:why if i want to walk the screen following like i control my screen? If i walk to top the screen following 2.when i want to move screen left/right the screen just zooming in/out 3.when i want to walk the screen moving right for nothing.. lastly, if i jump and then die on every game/server, i spawned again,and why the jump tapping like a ghost tapping it:(... Pls fix this bug...hope you notice this ty! And sry bad grammar:)💔",2
"This is a very fun game and is good to pass time fast. It has millions of different types of games like escapes , obbies , quizzes and much more . I just wanted to say that if you get frustrated fast then i don't recommend the game because you can get disconnected from the game anytime and you won't even know it . But you can also add friends and play with them and you can make your own avatar and that's why I rate this game 4 of 5 stars",4
"This game is very fun. You can do many things, you can build, roleplay and explore, there are some features that should be added and removed and a lot of bugs and glitches which usually comes out with a weekly update, yes it takes a lot of space so they should make the assets take less space.",4
"I like the vast universe of games, it allows you to play different games without a constant download. The in-game events are fun, and you earn an in-game token of completion in the form of an avatar item. Also, if Roblox seems to glitch when going into games (it takes you back to the home screen) it's a feature made so a higher quality game that is too much for your device to handle doesn't crash your device. And A suggestion for an update would be to trade player points for robux.",5
"Very good now. Lots of bugs are fixed and new clothes. This is probably my favorite online game and it has 0 ADS! There's one bug tho, On mobile the joystick will often move on its own so I'd have to go to the menu but sometimes it would lock my screen. And when I'm on my other account I can't get it to stop making my avatar to face 1 direction, this is annoying when I'm trying to make a character, I tried going to settings and mess with stuff but it didn't work. Overall it's a very good game👍",5
"Best game ever! Graphics for me (nice!) I love that there is tons of experiences that we can play! Just 1 thing, Please change the friend limit to 300. I have alot of people that I played with before that didint get to friend me. But if you fix that, it would be a way better game then now! 😀",5
"I've been playing this game for 2 years, but the main situation is whenever i join a server it always lags, nothing even changed when i update it. Talking about the controllers on mobile phones is that whenever it lags a bit it just walking itself, i had to leave and join again but when it comes from VERY LAGGY situation, my phone freezes and won't turn into normal, it suddenly restart my phone. I had to shut it down and restart it over and over again, you gotta fix this bug Roblox.",2
I love it! You can do what you imagine here! But there are some bugs I don't like 1. Sometimes when I click settings and continue playing it jump zooms in or out as I move 2. Sometimes when I'm changing my avatar it randomly quits the game 3. sometimes when I'm playing it will say please check your internet connection even if my internet is perfectly fine Please fix this but I rate this 5/5 cuz why not,5
"This game is underrated! Fun fact;; This game used to be named ""DynaBlocks""! This game is a very good adventurous game, multiplayer, and more! You can create games in PC! You can also make t-shirts too! Check out the tutors! The most recommended games are the current popular game, you might like it! Although, i have a trouble. It's, a bug where you CAN'T move your screen; This happens a lot whenever i tried to do something. It's annoying! Overall good one. [NOTE! This bug is common in mobile!]",4
I don't like that you can't talk in chat when using a Xbox. There is this bug that is very annoying on mobile devices when you are using the dynamic thumbstick. Sometimes the game thinks you are trying to use it to look around. So then if you are using the look around control you will just zoom in or out. And sometimes it is stuck like that until you leave the game even when you aren't moving around.,2
"It's amazing! Also Roblox i have something to tell you, make sure you read this :). So there's still a bug we mobile players wants you to fix it. 1 ""camera bug"" when we press screen with two hands it will be broken and the screen stuck/zooming in or out. 2 ""dynamic joystick bug"" sometimes when we move around the screen moving too (it's very uncomfortable for me). 3 ""jump bug"" Jump bug always happened because we spammed jump and then it's stuck. please fix those and thankyou for reading!",5
I love this game but it only has some problem that we all hope u can fix i will describe it on the games ive played so far like pet sim when i join and i clicked skip or not there's a black square sometimes it didn't and second (this is for all games) is within few minutes or hours when i move the screen it can't move it zooms in or out and when i rejoin the game it happens again pls fix this bug im not hating it but i just want this bug to disappear and roblox would improve for better rates,4
"This game is really fun and I get really interested and intruiged by it however I have some difficulty in the game itself. It takes a long time loading and sometimes I get stuck on the back of someone else's character. Also my icons most of the time keeps on jumping and I have to either reset or click off if it does. 8t might just be my computer but qll the other games I play on it there is no technical difficulty with it whereas in roblo there is. Overall, my experience with roblox has been fun",3
"The game is fine and a lot of choices. But the app itself is full of bugs ang glitch. One for example is the controls, it somehow doesn't support 3 or more fingers, if I tried 3, the screen would go crazy and the solution is that I have to leave the game and rejoin.",3
This game is really fun. I recommend it because it's a game with thousands of games in it. There are LOTS of different themes available 😀. I have never really hade any problems with it except it is a bitt lagge sometimes. But over all it is a great game. Please try to fix this problem it will be much better.,5
"It's an good game with good graphics, not that lag and pretty ""decent"" moderation and child ""protection"". The thing is that most of the time the roblox camera keeps crashing and when I try to pan my camera to where i want to look it just makes me zoom in/out instead of panning, and the moderation is TERRIBLE because i just put in a clean gui without any inappropriate stuff inside, i double checked the model and it has no viruses, bad stuff and robux scams. Hopefully you fix them, Thank you.",2
"It's ok. I changed it to a 3 star because it's good, but when they delete the clothing you bought with robux, it just takes up a slot in your storage and it doesn't even give you your robux back. It also won't let me get rid of the terms & agreements screen even though I read it and clicked agree.",3
"I'm a bit disappointed because sometimes I can't control it properly, it's zooming in automatically even I'm not doing anything and mostly, in the middle of my game I can't rotate my avatar but still can walk. It's irritating I wish u can fix it. Some games are cannot be save so when it happens it's frustrating to go back to the start.",4
"Amazing game, although this one bug annoys me do much It just makes me go insane: The Camrea Bug This bug makes it so that most of the time, when you to the menu on accident or something like that, you might have this thing where your camera is bugged by the fact that when ever you look around or walk somewhere, it always messes you up and you can't really control your character unless you rejoin the game. Imagine being in a fighting game. Please fix That. 😕",4
"This is game is so much fun and I play it all the time, but I think it would make it better if it had the graphics of a computer to make it even better and a lot more smooth to play on because some games are pretty high graphics and lag so if you added this plugin there wouldn't be even a lag spike.",5
I really have fun playing roblox with my friends! There are in app purchases like any other app but overall they don't actually affect the game that much. The only reason that I gave it four stars is because it depletes the battery on your device super fast which can be really annoying. It also takes up a lot of space on your phone.,4
"//// Regarding the new UI for us mobile players, the old UI is much better. \\\\ The inventory being easy to toggle and not disappearing when clicking off the menu allowed us to overcome the limited space of 3 slots when playing fighting games. The new UI may have provided more features but is overall worse because of this. They are crammed in one spot and is much slower to use so micro becomes impossible. You have all that space on the bar so why cram them in one spot?",3
"Highly recommended for ages 4 and up, really. It's a great game. The kids on there are fantabulous..well, most of them. There are some jerks on there, but what can we do? There are also small bugs, like chat messing up, camera getting stuck, etc. But that's just most online games in general, I guess. (For me, anyways.) I highly recommend for you to try it out if you haven't already, you make up to 200 friends, which I think should be updated to more, because hey, the more the merrier! ^^",5
"This game is really nice. I think it is really good, I play on both computer laptop and phone. I love to play royal high, but it doesn't let you play it on a phone. And if it does let you it is really glitchy to the point you cant even move. Then there are always bugs, like right now there is a bug that is like you have your clothes on in roblox and it just goes tiny, and it sucks. It really is a good game, but there are so many bugs in a whole year. Thx,hope you find this relatable or helpful",3
"This game is overall fun, and addicting. You can make friends and play some fun games, but I'll list what I have a problem on Roblox 1. Screen Moving whenever I walk ( I'm on mobile and this happens a few times to me, and whenever I walk, the screen also moves. sometimes the screen freezes and only zooms in and out. ) 2. Hackers ( I really hope you finish off banning hackers. They are annoying and exploit so they can have easy kills and etc, it's very unfair to the players.)",4
"This game is so nice, but there's a bugs... Iike i can't explain but whatever, my device is Huawei Media Pad T7 and it's so laggy, and when this game has updates i'm always disconnected with a stable connection.. fix it as soon as possible. The roblox bugs is so annoying For MOBILE PLAYERS.. whatever if this game can be fixed.. out of the bugs. It was really adorable.",3
"I will gonna talk about bugs, first of all the screen bugs it happens in most of mobile players is when you tap the menu while playing and when you go back to the game when you try to move your screen it just zoom and you can't rotate it, second is the jump button i don't know if it's only happen to me or to the others too but sometimes when I try to jump it bunny hoping when I'm not even touching the jump button and also I have good internet connection but why the game is take so long to load.",2
This is the perfect game for me I'll admit. But when playing on a phone there are some serious glitches where you can't even log onto Roblox. I love all of the games tough. But I would like it if you can fix this mess in the game for all phone users. Apart from that it is quite fun as their are lots of games to play and you can even design your own Roblox character! Thank you very much!,4
"Roblox is a very fun game. You can customize/create your avatar, but there are things that need to be fixed.First off, whenever u buyed something from like (a month ago) it disappears and doesn't give your robux back.Second off, sometimes u can't say things that aren't even inappropriate then it just shows tags.Third off, whenever you like touch and hold the screen all the way to the right or left on accident, it messes up the screen then u have to rejoin. Builderman please make these changes.",4
This game is amazing. I play on Chromebook I play on my phone and occasionally my X-box 1. I can't give 5* because of the major issues like how when on mobile the camera sometimes doesn't let you move it and rejoining Is anoying. Secondly on Chromebook when shift lock as the mouse hits the edge of the screen it no longer let's you Control the screen until you 360 back on to it witch is just a major flaw I would love that to be fixed. But all In all the game is super good. Add Hallowboihere,4
Roblox is a great game I've been playing for 5 years it's amazing. The only thing I want to change is to make it where you can like comment on games. Well that's a big change but in my opinion it would make the game even better! To other people who are looking at this and do not enjoy Roblox because it doesn't load property or lags it could be because you have bad connection to wifi or have a old/bad phone. Thanks!,5
The game functions like the mobile roblox but when it comes to playing the (HP chromebook ver) it's barely functionable. You can't even scroll and view other games with the mousepad they give you and the rotation on first player games doesn't even work properly. It only lets you rotate about 180 (not even a full 360 apparently). And if you close the app for at least 5s it instantly closes the experience/ game you're in. honestly the roblox on mobile is better than the google play ver on the HP.,2
"I like this game because it is fun and there is a lot to do, one thing though is that, there is some games that are slow but for the most part I've been playing this game for about 3 years I really like it, but would like it even more if they would fix some lagging and prices of faces and customizing things. BUT, I would fully recommend getting this game if you dont have it...",5
"Absolutely love this game,it's one of my top favourites,every-time I get board or I've got nothing to do I'm just playing this game it's incredibly fun and I love how u can make new friends and play different things, but the only problem is that when ur sometimes just stuck on the loading screen and you've got to update it quite a lot,but apart from that it's really good game to enjoy ur time on x",4
"So cool! Really recomend if you want to make some friends. But I have 2 complaints, 1. On the phone (for me) when I press the jump button, it just doesn't jump! 2. Couldn't you make like a way to get robux without paying? Like achievements, but don't make it too easy. Otherwise I love this game a lot! I really recommend this.",5
"Roblox is a very fun game I personally had some difficultes with games loading slow, but overall the game is so good and fun to play and it's online, you can play with friends. playing with friends makes the game so much better. Or you can even meet new friends and chat with them. I love the is game because if my child wants to play it, it's child appropriate.",5
Ok first of all really glitchy. I've deleted some games on my ipad and I have updated it regularly but the glitches will not go away! The other thing is I'll play with my friends in brookhaven and then they will want to play adopt me so we start playing but 10-5 minutes in it kicks me out! And I feel bad when having to say sorry this kicks me out. Sometimes crashes my game! What happens is it freezes then it blacks my screen the grey screen then loading that says launching experience!,4
"From 5 star to 4 star, I see a lot of mobile players are experiencing this problem: Camera glitch where it only zooms in and out. And even when you're on classic camera mode the camera still follows the player. You can't fix the camera glitch unless you rejoin and it's very annoying. Plus, the developers are focusing more on PC updates.",4
"Good, however some glitches have gone. The first one is that when I play Youtube Simulator X, I'm at the shop and then I get disconnected for no reason. My internet was great! Secondly, I was playing a game (since it happened on many games; I can't list them all.) But anyways, I was trying to move my camera, then it made me move. Thirdly, is when I was going to listen to some music on Spotify ( you know that spotify lets you go on portrait) but when I got onto Roblox, it put me on portrait.",4
"This app is actually not bad, however it acts really bad when i use my phone/mobile , and when i use my computer/pc its completely fine! But when i check the reviews they say the pc and the phone/mobile works perfectly fine so i think its something on how my phone/mobile is just not working for this app. But i still rate it a 5 stars, if this is a bug plz fix it roblox. Thank you for your time! Bye :) and I would also like to say, this game has bad qualities sometimes, please fix that too",5
"I'm Gonna give it a 3 star. It's really fun but, The app is breaking down. I've been experiencing troubles, Like getting kicked out for an unknown reason, The game freezing, Getting computer buttons instead of mobile buttons when I'm on a mobile, And stuck in lockscreen. I hope this app will have fixes soon.",3
"Very good app but it does need a very good signal in your area bcs if not youll be laggy all throughout the game besides that its has very good video games , really relaxing to play well it does depend on what you're playing but for me it is relaxing to play with and lastly it's very handy bcs its only on your phone so you can play& bring it everywhere you go . This Game is also a place to bond / interact with your friends online. I love the way you can style yourself but it does cost robux.",4
"This is a great game and I enjoy playing it! The variety and the creativity never ends while the community still succeeds. There is that one screen problem, though. I just use a cutscene that causes the screen to go back to how it was. It isnt perfect, but all the way anything else about it is great!",4
"This game is so COOL! It's one of my favorites, too. I really like it and I play it every day. And there are no ads! (which is kind of obvious but still) And ads are annoying af -_- But, I do have to say one thing. The moderation is really bad... There are all types of inappropriate stuff that aren't banned yet. Like Roblox $tr|p clubs, inappropriate t-shirts and other clothes, and more. But, I still love the game, and always will! I hope that in the future, I can make good experiences! :D",5
"The Game itself is good, but I installed today, and it stopped working after an hour, giving me constant messages to check my internet connection, even though I have LTE data and am connected to 780 Mbps wifi. I have tried clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, and messing with the settings, and nothing works. Until this gets fixed, my rating sadly is 3 stars.",3
It's great and I love it but sometimes it just closes the game you're playing and it's very annoying and it also disconnects a lot! It really glitches a lot. Sadly almost everything is for Robux and it's so unfair for the people who's mom and dad don't want to pay for a stupid game.I seriously love this game it's great! I like how they made Brookhaven with secret places and the funerals with funny notes on them and the game is just great! But please fix the bugs especially the robux one!,4
"I love roblox but when your screen moves and you can't turn it back thats when i have to reset my character, and when i play games like brookhaven, bayview and such,I have to get all my stuff back in place. Also it updates way too much, really every time I hop onto the game it will say ""Roblox needs and upgrade""!!!!!It so anoying, but overall, I LOVE ROBLOX!!!!! PS; i am obsesed with a game called Resturant Tycoon 2, TRY IT!",4
"Hello! I have a request. Can you update the authentication step 2 verification. like you click a ""reset authentication?"" Button, for turning off authentication without being logged on the account and type email then a button to send, in email message there's a button for us to turn off authentication app on account? Because there is a lot of us people losing our accounts because of it.. There are some people like me that lost their phone too. I have been trying to find a way for months on this.",5
"It's a really great games to play with friends, BUT, it can get really laggy in really any games, like just the screen randomly stopping, or just randomly moving, and it gets stuck, but you can make your own games on Roblox so I think it's pretty good overall. 5/5 Would recremend.",5
"This game is fun to play but there is the 2 same glitches I experience ( I'm on mobile) 1. Sometimes when. I walk my camera glitches and tilts down so I can't see. This is very frustrating especially in obbies. It can be fixed but not always. 2. My camera glitches and when I try to look around it only goes in or out it's very annoying and the only way to fix it is to leave the game which wastes time. Another thing is that sometimes it censors things that don't need to be censored like ""um"" .",4
It's a good game I've been playing since 2017 but it randomly crashes especially when I'm in avatar customization If I don't have auto rotate on sometimes it'll take up to 3 minutes to load in a game. If I play a game like royal high or other high quality games it immediately crashes even if my wifi connection is perfect and I have full bars,3
"Interesting game☺️, I actually play this game so much! It's full of fun, adventure, and horror🤣. I play The Mimic, Adopt Me, and Murder Mystery! Fun games. But anyways, I like this game. But there are a bit of bugs that I want fixed. 1. Why not place the friend requests on the top and not the bottom, it's fustrating when playing Tower of Hell on mobile, 2. You need to actually read reports more, exploiters or hackers are annoying and stuff. So I hope you fix it! Thank you💖.",4
"Absolutely GREAT! Except for the occasional lag (wich happens on all games) it's REALLY GOOD! It's great for creative minds, since you can play and CREATE games! Although you can get it on most devices and consoles I just really wish it was available on Nintendo Switch... Except for that, I would defo recommend for all ages above 8 years!",5
"This game is super fun and super actually,but theres a bug that when I load a game the screen is just pure black,I tried everything uninstall it and even deleting other apps but nothing happened,and the screen is bugged sometimes when I tilt the screen left or right it zooms in and out and when I move my character it looks up and down and the only thing to fix it is to leave the game and rejoin and I hate it sometimes,but overall this is a very fun and enjoyable app NGL but ill give it 4 stars",4
Bugs i see: In sometimes. When i wanted to move my camera to see what is surrounding me. It instead zoom in or zoom out! But overall if fine. Can you please also remove bombs on brookhaven? Its too annoying cuz everybody would be willing to rob a safe and i dont like that cuz it make kids be bad. I dont want to have this game a low rate because of attitude change. I want this game recommended for kids. Not for fighting and robbing. Or maybe remove vaults. Be better. Thank you. Looking forward.,5
"Even though this might not be my main game now, it is a game that has stuck with me for nearly 5 years now. Theres definetly something for everyone, regardless of age demographic. Of course it isnt perfect, sometimes reports aren't always handeled the best, like unfair punishments and the game itself bugs out or flat out crashes on occasion. Overall it's a very good game and I'd generally recommend it!",4
