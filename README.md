##### Project Status: Complete.
# Project Title: Playstore-App-Reviews-Scraping-Bot
A simple bot that scrapes the review and ratings data of any app on Google Play Store.
#### Before attempting to scrape data, take note of the following:
- You should have the reqiuired libraries.
- You should watch the demo video below.
- Read instructions displayed upon running of **"data_scraper.py"** script.
- The scraper typically takes about 3 minutes to scrape 2,200+ rows of data.

## Other things to note:
- When data is fully scraped, it is saved in the format 'app name_reviews.csv' in the downloads folder. 

## This bot was not built to break any laws of any sort. I built it for educational purposes and to scrap data for a project in this same user profile; Call of Duty Mobile ML/NLP project. It can and will be used to scrape app reviews for other projects.
