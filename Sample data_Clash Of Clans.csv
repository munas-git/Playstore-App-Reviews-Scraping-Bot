"I am enjoying this strategy game so far. For a beginner like me, it was easy to figure out. No blood and guts either! The only difficult thing is acquiring carpenter huts used to upgrade or build items. If you don't want to wait a long time for your points to accumulate, you have to pay money for them. Also, further on in the game they encourage you to use dark magic potions in your battles, which I find evil and a definite drawback.",4
"Clash of Clans is a great, fun strategy game, but there's a thing that really frustrates me. When you have too many trophies, your village gets attacked almost instantly after you leave the game. As a result, bases with many trophies have shields most of the time, making the ‚ÄòRevenge‚Äô button useless. I have a suggestion though: if the player hits the ‚ÄòRevenge‚Äô button, the red message should display the duration of the defender's shield or guard instead of only showing that the shield is active.",3
"I have a few suggestions, it would be great if you people can allow the production of speed up tokens for both villages in the clock tower and if also you can reduce the time frame for upgrades in the home village for buildings, troops, spells and heroes trust me it will be great because the current upgrade time for the home base is too much...Thanks guys I will continue to play the game, it is certainly a great game. We will all appreciate this in the next upgrade. COCüôå",2

"100 % an awesome game for my phone. I love the option of being able to create multiple bases, and being able to ""copy"" an enemy base. I've been a fan now for like 8 years. It's cool being able to communicate with people all over the world. A couple of things I've noticed that needs adjustments, in my opinion is. It takes way too long to upgrade buildings when you become a high level townhall. Also, buying anything with gems cost wayyyyy too much. But a great game. For real.",5
I've played this game for about 6 years. I love it. It's not pay to win. You can do everything for free. But you can speed up the process 3 fold by buying the gold pass each month which pays itself off. It gives you many items worth more than the cost of the actual pass. Supercell update and keep control of this game in many ways that even Triple A Console studios don't.,5
The game was excellent. I had a made a quite huge progress within a few days. But after these recent update my game isn't opening. When I'm clicking the icon a black screen appears and my game crashes. I tried to contact with supercell with a help form but it didn't get send. So I'm here please fix this as I've made a huge progress and and I didn't want to loose it. üôèüôèüôè,4
"Great strategy game that stays fun over the course of time (I've been playing for 6 or so years.) It is a game that takes time, but even at lower levels you can have fun as you build up to the higher levels. Matches are scaled by your current level and so the challenges will always be equal to what you can do. It doesn't mean it's easy, it does take strategy, but it does mean that it can be done. This also means that there is no pay to win as you're always matched equal to your strength.",5
"It's a really enjoyable game if you like to plan and strategize. In game purchase are incentivized and help you progress faster, but you can get to max level using free to play (though it takes quite awhile). I've been playing for a month now and upgrades have slowed down a bit. Playing multiple accounts has kept me busy though.",5
"The update is not as good as i thought it would be. I am happy about the clan capital and such, but the sound when you place your troop in battle has changed and tbh i like the old one better, and the outline to know where not to put troops in battle looks cheap, again i like the old one. It's still a great game though, great graphics, and performance, and like the other review it's the type of game you don't want to uninstall.",5
"Been playing this game for nearly 8 years now, and during this time it has been a constant and remains a part of my daily routine. It's probably my favourite chill-out game. I've had to restart my progress a few times because of issues with google play (nothing to do with CoC btw) but I've never lost interest in the game. It was also kinda nice to refresh and restart. I think it's one of SuperCell's best games, and definitely a favourite of mine. Here's to another 8+ years! üòä",5
"5/5 I love it, would download a 2nd time if it wasn't for Google limits. 1 thing I must mention is, the game is very grindy especially in the later Town halls. Supercell somewhat alleviated this via the end of season rewards. Alleviate doesn't mean solve though, if you willing to see this as a 2nd job, yeah, GO FOR IT. But for the ones who get on, play for 2 hours then get off. They're going to have a slower time upgrading. But it IS possible and to me, after all of that. It's a worthy download.",5
"great free game! I've been playing off n on for 7 years and love a lot about the game, esp how they've continued to add new things to help with the insane upgrade times/costs. Though I love that they do that, I do wish things didnt take 3 weeks and max storage just for 1 upgrade(late game). Also the pathfinding n matchmaking have been top cons of this game since day 1. they say they've fixed it but its still just as bad unfortunately. I do really appreciate that you can play truly for free tho!",4
"Hey I'm a player of this game since 2013. Never have I ever had any complaints about it, it's addictive and fun! I've been obsessed with it since I was little. But with the new update, I was too excited and after I updated the game, my game would automatically crash if I click the clan capital at first. And when I tried to fix it, I couldn't even load my home village. Idk what's happening but it would be helpful if you look into the above matter. PS: I've reinstalled the game about 5 times now.",2
"Overall a fun game, many people dislike the fact that upgrade times and costs are very high but that is just the more realistic part of the game, not like most other city building games. One thing that I've noticed is that people have very different but very interuptive bugs, not often do people have the same bugs. The game is very strategic and it does take time to become good at it but there are many YouTube videos and tutorials to help with that. It also has some internet connection problems.",4
"This game is full of strategies to play with, for example farming resources, trophy pushing and etc. I've I've playing this game for years now and I don't regret downloading it, after reading the comments I am deeply confused, There are no bugs and no wifi problems, keep the good work up supercell! P.S just a suggestion, I would love to have a feature that allows you to attack your own base so it would be easier for base designers to build a perfect base. In conclusion this is a great game!",5
"An addictive multiplayer game. Plenty to do. Purchases actually punished by unbalancing player development. Only purchase worth having is the ¬£4.50 monthly gold pass. But even that is not necessary to enjoy playing. Have been playing for about 10 weeks now and can see why some friends have been playing for years. Only problem is the ongoing connection issues, which have got to be a major pain after latest content upgrade.",5
"This game is really great and I love it but the only problem I have is that whenever I try to play the game, it kicks me out of the loading screen for some reason. I use an android device and whenever there are notifications or any background apps running, it kicks me out. I have disabled notifications and closed my background apps and it sometimes just doesn't work. Please fix this and I might rate it a 5 stars.",4
"The game is AWESOME, love the clan capital and the raids medals we get. The game is fun and non addicting but one huge problem that I face- the game rarely loads. I try to open the game, the loading screen shows and the bar goes full, but then the screen just goes black. This repeatedly happens and I became tired of it so I had to uninstall the game. Hope you fix this issue so I can play the game again",2
"Incredible game just a classic, and the new updates are amazing, I love the pace of the game not too slow to where you're waiting ages for upgrades, but slow enough for you to have things to do each day. The battles are 10/10. If I were to add anything though, I would make creating and getting more clan members easier somehow. After the removal of global chat it's been really difficult to build new clans",5
"The game is extremely fun once you learn the gameplay loop of attack to gain loot, then upgrade over and over. Thing is that works until about Townhall 8 or 9 and that will keep you busy for about a year. Once you hit Th 10 or higher, it has almost become work to maintain intrest because the wait times to upgrade and train troops to attack takes to long. (Builder base is the best in app solution but that only counts for the first 3 successes. Then it pointless to be on the base.)",4
"Love it. It is so much fun and even though all you have to do is check on it every few hours be ause the upgrades start to take longer, it is still fun to attack people while I'm waiting for something to finish. You should get it it's really a lot of fun. And alo the only game on the play store that has no ads, or just maybe very rare ads.",5
"Difficult to balance other life activities while ensuring that your base and your builders are always working optimally. I need to learn either not to care all the time (set a schedule?) or if it's too addicting I should probably quit. But it is interesting and fun to learn about the mechanics of the game and to develop bases and attack strategies. Addicting, but fun.",4
"Great experience before, but now I have a major Pproblem that seemingly came out of the blue; crashing. When I first downloaded this app for the first few months it ran smoothly, but now out of nowhere I'm starting to crash a lot. So much the game has became unplayable and I've tried to find solutions. I re-downloaded the app which temporarily fixed it but a few minutes later I got the same problem again.",3
I absolutely love this game. I have been playing this game for like 8 or 9 years and it still hasn't gotten boring. I would like supercell to create an option to where you can attack your own base to practice difference base layout attack strategies that are not in the practice panel. The game is still good regardless but it would still be interesting to have this option.,5
"The game is good I like it but idk what the hell is going on lately, even when I have perfect wifi and network connection toe game starts to tell me that I have wifi problems and while I'm attacking, the attack keeps going so I believe despite the sign I did my 100% but when I come back to the game it says that I only did like 85% when I clearly finished my attack. It has already happened twice and one more time today during the league! Because of that I'm losing and it's really annoying.",3
"great game overall, creative and dynamic. The only thing that I didn't like as much is that the game has a slight pay to win vibe and it requires a lot of time and sweat in order to complete it. It could take years until you max everything out and before you even can there will always be more to upgrade so that is something that seems like too much. Also a good suggestion would be to make gems cheaper or easier to get. The gem mine was good but it's very little the amount is gives.",4
"I've been experiencing crashes for 3 months and the disaster still exists, it crashes whenever I log into the game, checking the clan capital, checking the war (including war leagues), accidently pressed 2 building at the same time (even walls), and even when i'm trying to type in the chat. Oh sure I have a laggy phone but still, I need a massive performance boost such as disabling shadows, resolution, and effects. If you could add an option to optimize performance i'd be more than satisfied.",1
"Everything about the game works, I just have 1 big problem. Dont play this game on wifi, only use mobile data. Ive found if my wifi dips for even a second, the game says connection lost. This usually happens during raids, which is frustrating as it costs troups and trophies. I have tried this on multiple wifi networks. Wish it would get fixed, a game should be able to run for more than a second if the wifi dips a little bit.",4
"really smooth and easy but, when searching for a battle it should automatically choose the ones with the most loot so you don't have to press the search button so many times. A new problem recently is that the textures aren't loading, so it just looks like a black mess. Over all a four star game, still, I do recommend.",4
"it has a great graphics and calligraphy and was great to kill time if you dont have anything to do in home. especially during this quarantine. Hello supercell we happen to encounter a bug in the war where we cant attack the certain player saying that ""You can't attack this player tru again later"" ehat was that?? I'm trying to attack it for almost 2 hours now and yet I cant attack the base. There are 2 player in 30 vs 30. Thanks for fixing the bug but we didn't attain full star because ofthe bug",5
"Great Update. So glad you guys went through with a Mega Base idea and it was incorporated really well. Everyone gets a chance to participate and you even buffed the Trader while you were at it. Love how a newer, more detailed art style was used with the buildings since why not take the chance to, and the music fits the theme really well. Only issues are just minor bugs, like the Home Village becoming blurry after visiting the Clan Capital. Still, great update to start the year. I'm so hungry...",5
"Great game, it would have been 5 stars of it weren't for the new update. The clan capital update is good don't get me wrong, it's the new sound effects of stuff and for some reason my base is now low quality, if this is a bug hopefully it gets fixed. If it isn't I'd recommend to put the HD stuff and the normal sound effects back.. EDIT: they fixed the sound effect issue but the base is still low quality but at least they fixed the sounds, I'll be giving it a 5 stars now.",5
"Great game, I'm had lots of fun and I'm currently Town Hall level 8. The game is easy to progress, challenging and all the building prices are good. What I would suggest though is that when you are attacking and you lose connection, it doesn't forfeit the match and instead ends it with no loss of trophies.",4
It's an alright game. I check it about twice a day. At low levels you can sink a bit of time in building stuff but as you start to level up any upgrade usually take a full 24hours or longer. It gets to the point where if you want to do anything in the game youre really urged to pay for progress. If you don't mind waiting massive amounts of time though then the games alright.,3
Plz supercell fix the problem. After recent updates the starts to crash when it opened. By showing black screen and also the game load lately. After loading the doesn't work properly for a while. So my to the team of supercell fix it out. Because we like the game and doesn't want to lose it out. Hope you will soon make it better. üòûüò¢,5
A very fun and interesting game. But I had to change my mind recently because of the server. I've recently attacked a base and 3 starred it and the game reloaded again and made me lose 35 trophies (my network connection was very good)... and this isn't the first time this happened to me. Can you plz fix this issue?... I lost many trophies because of this,4
"It's a good game that i have been playing for a while now. The only problem? It disconnects you in the middle of an attack or worst when your attacking for clan wars and when it gets you disconnected then you lose stars/trophies. My internet is fast but somehow this app says i have a bad connection. It's not my phone or an update on the app. If they can fix this, it's a 5 no doubt.",1
"Great game... Been playing for 5 years now and it was all fun and exciting with different kinds of design, potion or base but recently I encountered a big bug and i the screen goes blank or black.. And it always happen when Im login in or tap setting button or in war too which is a very big problem for a player who spend a lot of time into this game and now I don't wanna leave it coz of the hardwork i took to build my base so please fix this as soon as possible also thanks for the great design.",3
"I have been playing for long and have never been really disappointed with this game. However, as other ratings state, there are connection problems, which one happened to be during clan wars for me. I had 2 stars and 96% and the connection got lost. When I rejoined, I had no second attack or any stars and we lost the war with a 2-star difference. I believe you should improve the progress of raids after a connection cutoff, like keeping on processing the attack with all the deployed forces",5
"Best game ever. No ads. But I keep getting ""Your defense lost!"" And I can't upgrade my defenses because I need more gold then my gold storages can hold to upgrade the village. The upgrade time takes pretty long and the gems required to skip is more than I can afford! My elixir runs out too when I'm upgrading the gold storages so yeah. However, this doesn't bother me much because I know this game is supposed to be challenging and takes time. You should consider downloading it.",5
"Great game without the need for quick reflexes. Multiple styles and concepts especially good as a team game (clans), but you can't compete successfully without spending money ‚òπ Update 2022. Still playing, still paying (about $5 a month). I play every day for about 30 minutes to make sure I'm doing my part in the build of the clan. Supercell keeps improving the game, but I wish they would add to the builder's village.",5
"Playing almost 10 years, not a bad game but it's getting busy. As if 2 bases wasn't enough, this new update now makes you take care of a 3rd base that does almost nothing for you, just one more reason to never put your phone down. Too much going on, too many side quests, events, wars, they pretty much want you to play 1-2 hrs a day, every day, or get kicked from your clan for not doing enough. They need to relax it a little, it feels like you have to log in 10x a day. It's becoming a chore.",3
"I've been playing this since release, it is great. But one big problem, lately I've been experiencing crashes when I click attack, and when it doesnt crash on that moment, then it will crash when it ends (where the stars appear) This situation is okay in a casual battle, but in clan war/clan capital raid, it's not okay. The game counts my attack but I don't even get my troops deployed. It sucks",2
"From the last update of clan capita the game is always showing black screen and if it opens which occur rarely when I want to go to the clan capital it again crashes and shows black screen. I had made a huge progress and i don't want to lose this. I had tried all the tricks like clearing catch data,updating both Android system web view and chrome but it didn't work. I request supercell to pls look into this matter as many of players are facing this problem...",4
"It is a very good game. I love it. But we need justice. For example : if we attack a base 100% = 27 trophies and loose = 29 trophies, if we get 50% We get only 2 or 5 in that war thats fare. But if we loose at 49 % the trophies correctly minus -29 . But why ? You should decrease the minus trophies to 13 or 15 . Most of us are like this . Many get angry and uninstall the game . Everyone would like if you bring this feature in the next update . Even though the game has great graphics. Thank you üôÇ",5
"I've played this game for over 6 years across multiple accounts, and yet it never ceases to entertain me. All the grind and customization really piques my interest, and the chief reason for why I have never gotten bored is the seasons which provide a really easy way to get magic items, which previously were very difficult to obtain. Best 5 pounds I've spent every month. Overall, this game is really good, interactive and player friendly from the tutorial all the way to max.",5
"Ok having played since 2018 this game is really fun, progressing is ok leveling up is ok as well you can use money to upgrade in game and also to upgrade your troops and that does give an advantage to players although I wouldn't personally call it pay to win. In this game skill does play a very important role and no matter how much money you spend on the game without skill you can't win. Edit:Tysm for fixing the loading bug. Now i can continue playing it just like before. Still cant do 5 stars.",4
I've been playing this game since I was a kid. It's a huge grind and alot of it is upgrading your buildings. It's can take up to like 10 days to upgrade a building in the higher levels but it's still super fun to watch your village grow. I also love the cute animations that they make for the game. It's definitely a game that's up there with minecraft for me.,5
"I used to regularly play this game before the recent update. After the recent update, as soon as I open the app, it just shows a black screen and crashes on its own. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app a number of times, but it still shows a black screen and crashes on its own. Please let me know how to fix this issue. (Will update rating post receiving any response and if the issue is sorted)",1
"I changed it to 4 stars because everytime I update it to a newer version it crashes right away, it fails even though I have strong data and wifi connection. When it goes to 100% it goes back to 0% to reinstall again and I always need to reboot my phone, clear data and clear cache. That's all my feedback for now. Please fix the issue.",4
I've been playing this game from last four years. And its really addictive. But the upgrading time of buildings and troops are so annoying. I think you should reduce the upgrade times of building for upper level townhalls. That will save a lot of time of players. Over all its a very fun game.,5
"Graphics are very creative and entertaining. The buildings the weapons and everything else are so life-like yet cartoonish. The sceneries are on a checker board ""village"". All the characters and setting are unique and collaborate well. It's a game of strategy that takes the ""edge"" off mind-numbing plotting attacks or defense strategies. A decent outlet for anybody with general anxiety or just bored.",4
"The rating system is quite, bad to say the least. In both villages i progress through the rating faster than i progress in terms of upgrades. So im forced to fight enemies that are way stronger than me, everytime i lose the rating will go down and that will make things balanced... for a few fights. After that it repeats.",3
"Why does the game keeps crashing with a black screen everytime I try to open the game or click any button inside the game?Happening since last year's Novmber.Been playing for 6-7years,never faced any issue.Even in play store there are lot of reviews pointing this issue. Fix this! There are so many reviews pointing this issue, still you're not fixing it or doing anything! Don't you care about your players Supercell? Seems like a massive uninstallation wave is coming soon if this continues.",3
"I've been playing this game since 2013-14 when I was a child and the max was th10. It's a great game, with its flaws like every single game to ever exist, but I never felt stuck when upgrading my village. For sure, it gets slow, reaaally slow, but that's something I really like since I don't truly enjoy a game where I need to dedicate my soul to. Time passes and you get better. That's it. And, at least for myself, the feeling I get of progress is amazing. sry for eng.",5
"This game is good. But when the clan games starts, everything just gets unsettled. In multiplayer attacks, it takes very long time to search and gives tough bases for really low, like 2-5 trophys.Many times i faced, after deploying some of my army in a attack, it can't be deployed anymore. Half of the troops still left but no buttone is working except surrender. Thus, this cause a defeat. This is so irritating. Why it have to messed up during clan games?? Please fix this issues to make us Enjoy.",1
Was great. But not now. Ever since the update the game has been bugging out. I try to battle someone and then it crashes. I reload the game and it says I'm in a battle but I never once seen who I was battling nor was I able to send troops. So 4 battles in a row I lost because the game crashed before it even loaded. Iv been playing the game for more than 8 years and now I'm thinking about deleting it because it's no longer fun to play. And people wonder why nobody likes or does updates.,2
"Every time I try to use the boat to go to the builder base, my screen turns black and my game crashes shortly after. This also happens when I try to open the season menu (where you see all the tiers & such). Edit: The issue still persists and it's gotten worse. I can't even get into the game anymore. I've tried contacting Super Cell and I tried all troubleshooting solutions they listed. Nothing works.",1
"I hope anyone hear my complaint, I'm a new player and I noticed that when I attack someone and I am confident that I will win upon him and suddenly, my internet disconnect for just a minute!! Surprise you are lost, so my opinion to you when any player attack with his huge army and the internet disconnected for any reason, you (developers) can make the army attack automatically and regardless of the results but at least we will do our best. üôè",4
"For the past months, Builder Base have been notoriously hard to grind for but the matching system quite improved. Last year most of of my opponents are rushed but their troops aren't so it's been a struggle, now I rarely matched with rushed Builder base, it's a big relief honestly. And with more events I can gather more loots. Keep up the goodwork supercell!",4
"gameplay is alright but building and upgrading things just takes too long, and uses too many resources. Where I am at everything will take atleast a week to build or upgrade, and upgrading walls just cost too much even though pretty much no one uses land troops, unless they can either dig below the wall or just jump over it",2
"I love this game, and I grew up with it through my early childhood. After this update however, it started to crash a lot. It never did before hand but now it just crashes within 20 seconds of playtime. Maybe they could fix thus but other than that, I love the game but cherished the classic Clash of Clans.",4
I'd like to start off by saying I do really enjoy playing this game... when you have your heroes to attack with. And that's why I give it only three stars. Later on in the game you spend months (and that's with the goldpass) upgrading your heroes per townhall. You feel useless every time they're down for upgrade. Honestly just let us use them while they're upgrading. Because right now the game becomes an unenjoyable farming experience while you wait on your heroes to finish. For MONTHS...,3
"Honestly, Great game Supercell Y'all did an amazing job on this game, I've been here since around 2010 or so. The graphics are good, challenging tactics, and a super duper slept on story. Overall to leave it short and sweet, pick this game up if you're looking for a game that you don't want to be a chore, fun, brain-challenging, but simple.",5
"Great game but lately there was this bug that bothers me so much which is a bug when you're getting a personal break after too long without shield. I have a 16h guard shield but i can't attack other villages anymore because the game keeps telling me to do a break from the game. But I've already done that and the game still kick me out the game and won't let me attack other villages. Other than that its a very good game not gonna lie, i highly recommend it.",4
"Though the upgrades are a bit too long when you get high leveled town hall, i like the fact that you can play the game anytime, like you dont have to be online in this certain time with a duration on how long you have to stay in the game or when you start you arent needed to play for like an hour. The graphics are insane and the game itself is just catchy, its a type where you can just keep the app in your phone and not even think of uninstalling it.",5
"Form the last updated of clan capital the game is always showing black screen and if it opens which occur rarely when I want to go the clan capital it again crashes and show black screen. I had made a huge progress and i don't want to lose this. I had therid all the tricks like clearing catch,data, updating both Android system web view and chrome but it didn't work. I request supercell to pls look into this matter as many of players are facing this problem.üôèüòüüò•",1
"In March, My COC keep crashing that's why I uninstalled it. But Last week I installed it again because I missed playing it but the bug is there. I tried to uninstall and install it over and over again after that it still there that's why I tried different methods to fix it. But then again I knew my phone wasn't the problem but the game itself. I will change my review if I stop experiencing this issue ever again. COC Dev, please fix this issue since a lot of people have been experiencing this.",2
"Great game! Just takes too much time... I have been playing this game on and off since release, and I always end up coming back to it. What stops me from playing here and there is the amount of time it takes to progress. Since release I've only made it to TH 11. It's hard to balance real life with this game if you want to progress fast(unless you use the micro-transactions). Gave it 4 stars due to the fact that it takes forever to progress if you don't play 24/7.",4
"Verry great game. Verry little bugs happen, when bugs happen they get patched quickly. Other than slight bugs once in a blue moon its a perfect game, paitence is key. Would love to see some kind of mini game situation for when every builder is buisy and nothing else is happening. A daily base attack challenge mini game that gives rewards would be awesome, basically games to help farm potions, gems, capital gold and more, similar to the campain but on a daily rotation with different rewards. 5/5.",5
"Edited this review from 5 to 2 stars... It's been too much now, the game is crashing a lot, can't even open the game and do a simple task of opening the CWL map, before the Clan Capital update as well it was crashing but I kept my patience, but after the update the crashing problem became 5√ó, so can't bear this problem anymore, making the experience of my most favourite game a nightmare, can't even look at my home village zoomed out for 10 secs without crashing. Am disappointed SUPERCELL.",2
"Very nyc game..., used to be..but after the recent update it stopped working properly. Screen is going black.., every time i change between any kind of village or transition, can't even play..since 99%of times it does not start properly, really annoying, and sometimes idk why after trying many many times id starts üòîü§¨.. Please.... Do something about it fast!..... Like soon please... Or else just close it... Save ours and yours.. Everyone's time! üôÅ",1

"Very amazing game and experience. It's upgrades, strategies, attacking and now capital gold is just making more addictive. One tiny thing: the upgrades in this game consume a lot of time. Other than that, it's an anazing with amazing features and ne being a coder knows how complex code can be when u code every troop separately and combine them!!!",5
"Love it, had no issues playing it. BUT for last two days, my game can't be open. When I click the game icon, black screen appears and then it crashes every time. Please fix it. I'm not worried about my account, i have it backed up by supercell but if possible i would like to play the game üòÖ",3
"This game is good . I think none of the game will run like this for years . But there are some issues with this app . The screen suddenly becomes black while opening the game and sometimes doesnot open in somedevices . Please include heroes in war even if they are in upgrade ( you get it ?) . If we upgrade heroes , we dont need it in normal attacks let it upgrade but we badly need heroes in war..... so please bring a new update for heroes in war ...please i req you for this. I hope you will do .",4
"This game is marvelous. This gives me grateful time when playing because it allows you to think logically on how to attack other base. Moreover this game is fun to play. Only thing that I did not like about this game is the upgrading system because it takes to much time to finished one upgrade, the higher the upgrade the longer it takes. But it is a fun game. Obviously!",4
"It's an amazing game but IF you really want the players to go back here's my suggestions. REDUCE the time/countdowns in building armies. After an attack DO NOT remove all ARMIES that were NOT dead. It's very tiring to wait for long period of time to complete your armies every after an attack. The tendency is, it's not enjoyable anymore after an attack you'll wait again for a long time.",1
"its awsome üòç I love the P.E.K.K.A.S and dragons. but you should add more troops and heros or a custome hero but its cool üòé and that once in a while that hero skins are free. cuz not everyone can pay. you wuld get more ratings. Update: when getting the town hall at a higher level, it starts getting ridiculous the time it takes to upgrade stuff, A week at most, Its ridiculous man, come on it's still a good game but wuld be better if you know. changed that.",4
"Decent, but the second ""Builder Base"" they added a while ago to help keep us occupied while you are building an army or doing upgrades is now useless. I've had that 2nd base maxed out for over a year, and there's literally no more to play for. My stocks are full so if I win a battle, it just tells me my storage is full and I get nothing... But they keep adding to the normal base. So I still play, but not nearly as much.",3
"This new update is having issues, a whole lot of issues, black part on my screens in my base, in clan capital and when I attack, constant crashing, alot of bugs. I'm in Legends league and it logs me out when I'm attacking, I'm losing trophies and it's annoying, please please and please do something about it.",1
"It's a fun game no doubt, but edge close to a pay to win. You can get very far like everyone else but if you don't spend real money to skip upgrades it takes forever. I've been playing close to 3-4 years I think without even spending real money. Now I'm close to upgrading my Townhall to 11. It's a very very long journey.",3
"Its a really cool game, no hackers, no glitches for currencies. Its not pay to win mostly and it has no bugs at all. The only thing that bothers me is the waiting. Like when you get to town hall level 8 the building time is just ridicilous. For a barrack on leve 10 it needs 1 day and 12 hours, and for one xbow it needs 2 days. But it can be fixed with potions, gems and the builder book, so i guess its fair but it just bothers me that for a cross bow i need to wait 2 days.",5
"I give this 1 star because of a problem. I have reached town hall 7 and after that, whenever i open the app everytime, I mean the literal everytime, it is stuck on the loading page saying ""downloading contents"" then after a few seconds it says ""connection lost"". My internet connection is very strong, when I switch to other games the internet is strong but when I open CoC, it always say ""connection lost"". Now I can't open my account. Please fix this problem ü•∫ I miss my account üò≠",1
"From the last update of clan capita the game is always showing black screen and if it opens which occur rarely when I want to go to the clan capital it again crashes and shows black screen. I had made a huge progress and i don't want to lose this. I had tried all the tricks like clearing catch data,updating both Android system web view and chrome but it didn't work. I request supercell to pls look into this matter as many of players are facing this problem...Fix It plz üò†üò†üò†",1
"The game is good, but can you fix the troops AI? they always prefer defending troops rather than buildings, WHY?! I HAVE LOST SO MANY BATTLES BECAUSE OF THIS ( 18 to be precise). Also also, the dragons wings, why is it that it looks like the wings are poorly connected to the main body? Though higher level dragons have fixed the problem the lower level visuals is bugged.",4
"The upgrade times are ridiculously long. I mean come on. Why do they have to be so long? I don't understand the concept here. Game would be better if we didn't have to wait days and days for upgrades to finish. I love the game but the upgrade times are keeping it from getting 5 stars. I, along with others would like to see the upgrade times lowered. Hours, fine. Days, unnecessary.",3
"I am rating just four star because this game is good and has good graphics but if you lost connection while attacking you have log in again and you cannot enter the battle again and the only troop you deployed will attack the village and you wins or lose the battle by not supporting your troops.Supercell should fix this problem because it feels bad if you lose the battle and your trophies falls down and cannot gain the loot in the battle, Otherwise this game is too good.",4
"I love the game, and have been playing for a year or two now. However, every single time I try to open the game, it loads for a little while, the bar goes slightly past the word ""Loading,"" then sends me back to the home screen after a bit of lag. I don't know if there's a way to make the game load every time, but eventually I can play. Great game, except for the opening bug. Edit: The bug has been fixed and I can now fully enjoy the game. :)",4
"It's fun building and raiding, but it's getting frustrating with the BH raids cause I'm always put up against a BH a level or two up. This makes it pretty difficult to get resources, which are needed to level things up. Leveling items up is kinda the game, so...... It's getting easier to pass the app when looking to play a game.",3
"I've been playing this game a long time, years in fact. Originally I gave COC 5 stars, I changed my review cause I couldn't get 1 of my accounts to transfer to another device. Contacted customer service got absolutely NO help. I gave them all information concerning the game and still got NO help, so I'm stuck playing the game on a smaller device even though my games isn't lost.",2
"The new update (Clan Capital) has brought me back to Clash of Clans and it's been super fun besides 14 day building times. I don't feel like taking 2 weeks to upgrade something. It's so annoying. I'd buy the gold pass for reduced time but it is still a week and a half so I'm not buying it because it's not worth it. Additionally, clan capital doesn't add many medals either and there aren't any items to speed building upgrades up which is absurd, especially since most of my upgrades take 14 days.",4
I do love this game. I've been playing it for a few years and is always really fun. There are a few things I think need fixing. Builder Hall need more ways to get loot. It's taking for ever to get it done on super easy upgrades. Or nerf the prices. We need a different way to get medals instead of the clan leader picking who gets them. For one if you have 40 or 50 members in the clan. Thats just never gonna be fair. Or if the leader keeps picking the same people. Not fair. But that's it IMP lol.,4
"I got the star bonus and somehow it exited before could collect it so it all went in my treasury which is full so basically I lost out on loads of money which took me ages. They should say 'are you sure?' whenever you select something cause this sort of thing happens all the time. Other than that, it's a good game, despite being obviously designed to be as addictive as possible and to make you click on the game regularly and get you hooked.",3
"I just finished updating the latest version today and was going through the mechanics of the new map. But why is it that whenever I clicked on the 'Practice' button for the raid tutorial, the game suddenly restarts and all troops including siege machines that were in my clan castle disappear? This happened two times now. Please explain.",3
Such a great game bt it takes a lot of time to upgrade items and buildings further. In the beginning upgrades don't take much time like 2-4 hrs but as u progress in game it increases up to 2-4 days and more n more. Except upgrade time the game is just great . I think u should decrease that otherwise I love this. And the new update is decent but graphics are slightly low compared to before. idk I think this or the matter is really like that.,4
Disgusting A.I. like fix your targeting its so bad and it has been for so long. Let us choose things to prioritize or atleast some more control. Had to lose in clan war because my edragon decided to randomly stop attacking the townhall at 1hp and went after a barbarian king who couldn't do ANYTHING to him. 1 star until its fixed. But the game is good apart from that. Definetly reccomend.,1
"No warnings of maintenence, and i get kicked out while in a battle, meaning I'm going to lose trophies through factors i had no control over. I must constantly fight 2 Town Halls higher than me to get even 10 trophies, while one attack from someone my level drops me 30. Where's the incentive to play when I'm constantly punished for playing?",2
"I really like this game very funüëç been playing it since 2016. unistalled it a while back because of new phone,and now that I reinstaaled it whenever I try to open game my screen goes black and also even if it opens whenever I have to go on a different page like the clan war page or to attack someone or just to edit my base and it is really irritating and after reading other comment seems many people are having same problem so ,I request pls fix it and make the game perfectüòÄ.",4
"Awesome, this game makes me feels victorious because of the battles that I made during the time that I'm playing these also relates to the planning of attacks and upgrading the base inorder to unlock the new weaponry and even new trops and most of time I learned patient to gather gems and buy a worker and it's pretty difficult to earn gems that's why I loved the game to the fact that it is challenging, lastly it improves our capabilities to lay out our base and design our own style of fightings.",5
I like it because you can get every few days not worry about falling behind the other player playing. I can get on it when I want and not have to worry about taking too long. And last of all I like that there's two different worlds you then take time to play and build the other one you can play for hours without getting board because you have a infinite Army.,5
"This is a great game, it has good graphics and the audio as well. However, what I hate the most in this game is the lack of control of troops. Can you add some features where we can lock a target building? It's kinda troublesome sometimes because the troops keeps attacking the building that I don't want to attack. You can add it on settinngs where we can turn on and off target lock buildings so that if some players didn't like this feature they can go back to the old one.",3
Great game with complex planning and strategies. Very fun and addictive. The only disadvantage is the upgrade timer. It keeps getting higher and higher as you progress through the game. You require patience to progress if you are a free to play player. The game is lot fun and faster if you buy the gold pass. It's very helpful for begginers as well as experienced players,5
The sound effects of the entire game after the recent clan capital update have been ruined . Every building sounds like a wall click when selected and troops and spells deployment sound effects are also different. Tried reinstalling the game but it did not solve the problem. Fix this as it is very unsatisfying to play the game like this.,4
"Last version of the game without the new features of new base. The game is working on my phone. But when it get into the newest version, I experienced black screen. After the loading screen of COC it will turn into black screen, but there's a sound of the game which totally the game is in the village, but I cannot see and tap the village because of the black screen. Please fix this issue, and I will change my ratings.",1
"I've played this game for 8 years, & loved it. However, this most recent update adding a capital area just became too much... it's overwhelmingly too busy now, and the new capital game theme feels like a different game influenced by competitor executives who were brought on board (bringing lame ideas) who probably got dismissed from the previous game co they were with.",4
"It's dangerously addictive, and incredibly entertaining. My SINGLE gripe with it (That comes to mind)?: If an AI is faced with a lvl.1 wall vs a lvl.10 wall? ‚âà 9/10 it'll go for the lvl.10... when they lead to the same target... It's... Stupid... And annoying and a time-sink and, and, and... But it is a great game outside of that Edit: nvm, 6/5 stars, occasionally P.E.K.K.A's will chase butterfly's like it's nobody's business, and I love that",5
"This game is just stop working after 2-3 weeks it crashes without loading and everytime it only shows as once upon a time in a clearing in magical forest..I tried all prospects as clearing data, uninstalling then again reinstalled and also rebooted the phone but it still does not open and graphics are so bad then other games.It also shows wifi or network problem in most running matches and when I check my network in other games it is perfectly fine due to his fault I defeat in winning games.",1
I love the game but the getting rid of global chats was an extremely bad move. After doing that 68% of the players left the game and finding clans that are active became impossible. I'm nearly a max TH8 and I've never spent a penny but I'm doing really well. The game is still somewhat fun but without global chat there is no communication of any kind. I would not recommend the game to others at this point.,3
"I'm so sorry in advance, in fact I wanna give this app 5 stars but to upgrade anything in it, it is a waste of time or too long, it makes the game boring. Please reduce the upgrade duration and I beg you to find a suitable opponent so the game is fair and fun to play Your Majesty Supercell, I'm TH 6 and a level 9 town hall player can attack my base and he/she got many trophies and resources. What an unfairness is this!!!! Make your game balance and suitable for every player!!!",2
"I've been playing this game for so long i can't remember how long. I loved this game, the only game i would play everyday everytime. But what annoys me is that many times when i requested extra troops from clan mates (which happen to be from the game on my other phone) when i already succesfully sent some troops but the troops is somehow not delivered but the requested space is already full ! I have to wait for another 15 mins before i can request another back up !! Please fix your server asap!",1
"Really good game, just abit too much waiting time for buildings and upgrades so have to buy gems or would be waiting around all day for builders to do there job and then again once they done have wait again only down side to the game only reason for 4 stars or would of been 5 star. please lower the building and upgrades time would be absolutely wonderful game if didn't have wait all the time for everything still addicteding game tho !!!!!!!!",4
"Really great game, sure it could take some time upgrading all the buildings but it works for me. May I suggest that a mode that you can attack your village so I can fix the flaws of my base that would be much appreciated.",5
"This game is my all time favorite and an issue I have is I can be doing so well to the point where om about to 2 or 3 star and the game logs me off and it stays as 1 or 2 even worse when the game is about to start I bearly deploy troops and logs me off and I get 27 24 26 etc trophies taken due to me ""attacking"" fix the issue or at least don't take your trophies honestly disappointing from you guys.",3
"However game is great......but if you reach higher leagues the matchmaking system will only (most commonly) higher townhall than your or if you are able to find same level (th) it will award you extremely less trophies....but if someone attack you (with same or higher townhall) you will loose twice as much troohies if not more.... I suggest the team that matchmaking system should be based on townhall level, tropies and experience and winning or losing ratio of tropies should be similar.....",2
"Great game (3. 5/5) 1 star because it keeps asking to ""Update for best experience"", every single time which is very annoying. I know, and have known since the first time I was notified. I don't want to. Even after the update there is no noticeable change. Even before the update the game was running fine as it will be after updating. Seriously, seeing it again and again makes me want to not play it any more.",1
I really like this game but i have a small problem the upgrade timers are ridiculous! They go up to like 6-7 hours its bad and good the bad side beingyou have to wait a long long to upgrade the townhall and it took me 5hours to upgrade my barracks the good side being you have to put down your phone for a while sometimes because of high up grade timers you wont be watching your phone all day and props to supercell for making a great game,5
"Addictive as heroin, Just another quick look to see what's happening in the war! Played this game when it first came out and it was good then, however the content and game play have improved greatly since then. If you join a good clan who all interact, this game equals a console game. No adverts or pay to win but of course if you do pay for gems things move much quicker but hold tight and have patience and you'll still have a good time playing. Well worth installing.",5
I love the game. It does have a glitch though. If you lose your internet connection at any point of a fight the games counts the fight. I recently started a clan war league fight and before I could start anything I lost my connection to the server. When I got back in to the game it counted that as my daily fight. This also recently happened to my son.,4
"Very fun game and very addictive, no longer pay to win. However the game keeps losing connection constantly which is very annoying. It isn't my own Internet connection as it occurs not just in my house. Other than that, very addictive",3
"Umm where should I start oh 1- it's really fun to play and addictive, 2- the only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 because the gem prices are stupidly HIGH like $1.00 to $100.00. 3- maybe lower those prices to $10.00 instead not $100.00, and $10.00 is the max limit of cost and then I would give it 5 out of 5 stars but for now 4 out of 5 stars. THANKS!",4
"My daughter asked me to try this game. I've never played a rts b4. I'm a role playing, sim building type. It's a steep learning curve. I get frustrated waiting for my builds to complete but I'm addicted. Often I log in and stare at the screen just watching seconds elapse on my builds and upgrades.",4
"It's a very nice game hand easy but the upgrade time is too long and the wall upgrade when you reach town hall 11 up to town hall 14 are too expensive. I hope you can lessen the time update so that we can upgrade our building, heroes, and troops fast. Also i hope the resources needed for the upgrades will be cheaper",5
"The HUD is excellent, buttons are well-labeled and responsive. The UI design is also superb, it is fully optimized in a landscape type game. The animation is smooth. Characters are very detailed. The mechanics of the game is easy to understand. No ads throughout the in-app experience. Overall this is a best app with a 5 star rating.",5
"Game had become fairly boring. Recent update has made it interesting again. While free to play is a viable option, they aren't constantly throwing ads to buy things for the game in your face like some games. I buy the monthly $5 gold pass and about once a year I might get the $100 gem pack. Playing 2 maxed accounts, I am going to start a 3rd.",5
Great game. Didnt want to play it at first but my brother got me hooked a few years back. Loving the latest update though. 1 complaint... About 3 updates back my game started stuttering and freezing for short periods causing me to loose focus and lose some attacks. Please fix this as it is really irritating. Still 1 of the best strategy based games i have ever played,4
"So i reinstalled the game because i wanted to play again because of nostalgia, however, when i open the game it just loads like,1/4 of the loading bar before kicking me out. I tried everything, from clearing my data to uninstalling it and re installing it, but it still doesnt work. I even checked my internet connection but its fine and stable. Please fix this issue cuz i wanna re experience the game again =<",1
"I love this game. I have been playing this game for like 3 months nearly and I have been loving this game. Easy to play, no glitches at my point, but only thing i like to have is the build-time, pls make it a bit less, the upgrading time and more, pls decrease it, I am at town hall 9, and i have suffering from build time alot. Thanks but overall a great game. Keep up the hardwork.",5
"I have loved this game since its creation, I quit roughly a year ago due to drama in real life. Started playing again and noticed a new feature. I very strongly dislike that donations are now capped at a certain level (depending on town hall level). I will be holding my money and stars until this is remedied, thank you for an otherwise great game",3
The new update really has nothing to offer the season passes are repetitive. Tbf it's just 2 grindy its take a lot of time and in the end u pretty much just wasting your time. There is definitely some incentive to buy the pass with all the ads surrounding it.I liked it yrs ago but it's really no change more like some tweaks. Cash grab game,1
The game is very interesting. I am new to play this game. I will give a better review later when I have had more playing experience. At the current time I am having trouble purchasing packs...it keeps giving me an error message please wait.... transaction pending. This is not user friendly.,3
"So fun! Takes some time from my day but still a great game!! Worst thing is that everything takes a unreasonably long time to upgrade everthing when ur th 10 and above. Edit: I Hate the fact that when I open this app when I'm listening to Amazon Music, the app closes my tunes. Like when I turn on the app while listening to music; clash of clans says nah no music and shuts down Amazon. (I have a android samsung phone)So I am dropping it down to 3 stars.",3
"I hate the fact that it forces you to transfer to another network with a stronger connection during a match even though the current network has almost max bars. Because of that switch, it reloads the game and logs you out of the ongoing match causing an auto loss. Need a better dev.",2
"Great game have been playing for a long time but I only have 1 complaint, and that's the attacking ai. To put it blunt it sucks which doesn't change the game much but really makes me mad. The troops always attacks the resources and always wait till after to attack the defense which 9/10 kill them by the time they are even close to them. Great game but please fix the ai.",4
I've been playing for years . it takes a lot of patience to play without spending money but I haven't spent a dime and never would. I'm a TH12 now and every upgrade I have takes 14 days. my storages are continuously full while I wait 14 days for each builder so I'm here on the play store looking for another game. maybe I'll come back in 14 days and maybe I won't but I'm sick of looking at a screen with nothing to do for 2 weeks at a time. sooner or later I'll just stop coming back.,1
"great game! i've played this game before back in 2015, and came back again this year, it was great looking this game got so much update, and one suggestion from me, if possible can you make the 3d model of the hero in the ""change skin"" feature more high quality? because for me it doesn't look very good. Other than that, nice game!",5
"Lately , your game got major bugs which often shown network error eventhough my connection runs smoothly with other games & apps . Today , it goes critical when i try to run coc and just end up stuck at front loading again & again . It sucks ! Please fix !!! Cwl is near the corner !!!",1
Really one of the best strategy game out there. I've been playing it without any problem till the clan capital update. When i click on clan capital then my screen would turn black . I've deleted n reinstalled it a few times but the problem is still there. So plz if the devs can kindly look into this matter n solve it then i will be very helpful. Thank u,4
I give this app 0 star. The game is really good. But since they have added Clan Capital I have not been able to buy any in app purchases. I get an error message saying that I need to live in the United States. And I DO. Have never once been out of the country. I have told the support team this and still they have not resolved or fixed their bug or whatever the actual issue is. Truly they don't care. Horrible customer service. 0 Star!! Unfortunately I have to give it a star. REALLY 0 STAR!!,1
"As someone who has been interested in playing strategy games lately I can say that this is a really great game as long as you have the patience and consistency to improve your base, it is fun and competitive especially during clan wars, wherein you and your clanmates competes for who gets to destroy the easier enemy base.",5
"The AI is stupid. Constantly asks you to spend money. Otherwise you have to wait for hours or even days before you can play again. This game decides when you play. 2 games of type 1, 3 games of type 2 (after a certain level), 5 games of type 3 but only in the weekend (after a certain level), and everything else is just selecting upgrades to then wait days for to complete.",1
I've been playing coc since 2015. But truly now the game is not as enjoyable as before.I took break for 21 days and when i started playing again my heroes level have been decreased My queen was at 42 level and warden at 10. After coming back i have a queen of 40 level and a warden of 8!! Totally disappointing because I wasted 2 book of heroes to level up the queen.,1
"Using navigation gesture on this game to change apps is not working as intended. When slide the pill shape to the right, usually will go to the previous apps we use. But the behavior is different, it just go home instead. I am on android 12 right now.",4
I recently spent approximately $600 upgraded many things Town Hall weapons walls. And then yesterday on May 31 I had to Google issue and had to restore everything that I possibly could at wise. It was bad enough that I lost many photos that I can no longer replace but what angers me now is that when I try to reclaim my clash of clans game I have been unsuccessful. Their suggestions are complicated and their help and support team is equally complicated to reach out to. No response.,4
"Battles, clashes & trophy rewards between DIFFERENT LEVELS is NOT QUITE FAIR. I was on level 4 & another attacker was from level 5. Truly level 5 won, 100%, and got like 26 trophies ! I fought a level 4 on another battle & only GOT like 9 trophies, despite winning 100 %. Other trophy rewards are quite NOT in proportion too, like you need to win 100% to get 28 trophies vs. you ONLY get 10 trophies if you win 98% of the same clashes. Irresponsible, sick ideas. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé",2
"Dear supercell, please fix da problem frm da builder base. Da fight in dat base is too much. We gain more tropies fr better loot bonus but da higher da trophies the more chance of losing coz der is big builder hall level diff. So we lose in streaks ! Atleast 5. My longest was atleast 15. Not coz of bad attack but coz da opponent was way higer level than me. Let it not be according to tropies but by hall level. Home base, we have a choice to fight it or not but not in builder. Please fix and help",3
The waiting. To do an attack in Legend league is way way too long... plus you only get eight attacks and you have to wait like 8 hours... it's ridiculous... it should be like any other league ... it would make it more fun if we could attack more often... we earned our way up there... the last thing we want to do is sit there and get pounded and then we only get eight attacks... the amount of trophies we lose when we get attacked is horrendous..and earning them back 4 or 8 at a time is not fair.,4
"Amazing in the main game, but the whole clan capital bit is EXTREMELY buggy. Every time i try to pull up a capital village, there is a graphical error or it just crashes the game. Please fix this bug soon. I really wanna enjoy these clan capitals.",3
Great game. I have a max th 11 acc a few years back on an old phone but it got broken and I kinda lose that acc and it make me not want to grind and play anymore but after I give it a try again I realized the game got easier than how it used to be but of course not that easy to the point its boring so it draw me back to playing and now im addicted to this game just like before. Great game and definitely a 5 star from me,5
"I love clash of clans but one thing I really hate is that most base's I try attack has loew trophies and high loss trophies for example 2 trophies and 38 loss trophies. Please change this, it is unfair and takes me like 20 minutes to find a good base with decent trophies and loot.",2
The game is very good i have a very nice experience of years this one of my favourite games but now a days in clan wars there attack limits means we get only 1 or 2 chances to attack and then we can't attack because a long time countdown appears on screen that you cannot attack on any person of enemy clan until the countdown finishes so i request developers to replace that feature with the feature i.e. you can attack on any person of the enemy clan at any time.,4
"Last update on coc destroy every sound. sound in the basse, are attacking sound. No logical sound and affect are happening . I liked the old coc like 2years ago. Everything was quite interesting and attacking was challengeing and this game was piece full . But now it is messed up",2
"! .. after update clan capital, it's always show loading screen.. ! even i have normal signal Internet. so i reinstalled it but now I can't even open the game is always loading in the open screen, nothing move in loading bar for long enough until is show.. 'Login failed Please Try again later' over and over i tried. - AND YES my signal is normal cause i reinstalled game just fine. but can't play the game",5
"great game, however ptw it is still fun. good progression system, and you can choose different ways to progress. clan system is good, attacking is great, and you can connect with other players easily.",4
"It's a good game but it doesn't have good support, I have an error, I wanted to buy but I can't make the payment, I have two linked accounts and the wrong one is always selected, so I can't pay, it's strange that they don't prioritize income..",4
Since new update and even before but more recently this app is amazing I have had it forever and I don't plan on deleting it. The new single player showing tutorials for all town halls is amazing the clan raids are so fun with clan wars and normal battles and night mode or whatever so much to do and with it being a long term game just a great app to have on the side to pick away time with and progress,5
"I'm regretting now ..... 1: troubleshooting network problem 2: I'm in legend league btw.. it litrly took 7 hr to search for a base for attack I'm down 3: smooth network still saying network issue 4: lagging infinity while doing atck war , normal ....this game used to make me happy like this is my everything üóøhard to believe these things happening but I'm still playing.... Try to solve these problems so many clashersh out there struggleing ... Clash on üèÜ‚ú®I'll update my review again . thanks",1
"Update. It is one of those epic games you will always go back to. You will always have it on a tablet or your phone. It is a consistently fun game. You might put it down for minute, the pay to play vibe might getcha, but the story, the options to play while waiting for the next adventure makes it worth it. Build your city and have fun.",4
"I am extremely happy with this game. While it provides enormous benefits to players who can pay money, it also does not leave the f2p players alone. I love the new updates and the super cell system where you can switch devices. This game also teaches you patience as you can't get far within a few days. Keep up your great content; looking forward for more new updates!",5
"The support team are either bots with human names or just super dumb i have been trying to recover my village that i played with 7 years ago and i even managed to sign with my old account but whatever i explain again and again on the emails they just redirect me to the useless game support and i get stuck with another bot called otto in a loop without being able to reach an actual person, as if that will even help. I only wanted to play this washed up game again because my friends asked me to.",1
Have you guys considered allowing players to use heros (maybe for war only) while they are upgrading just like army camps and clan castle. Maybe hero potion or a new potion that let's you do so for an hour. Having to spend months collectively without being able to play war is really unfun. But otherwise really fun game. Hope someone sees this from the team.,3
I have been playing clash of clans for about 4-5 years. And i love playing this game. The only problem i have is the clan find new members button. Most of the time when i try to invite people it will say that their player inbox is full. And it won't invite them. This happens more then when i can invite people. Besides that i love the game. Keep the great work supercell!,5
"Clash of clans is awesome , at first you will start with a very small and weak village but as you evolve and upgrade your villag including you're troops, defences,loot storages,loot collecters , Baraks to train you,re troops to take them into battle to attack other villages in order to gain more loot last but not least don't forget to upgrade your town hall to gain more defences,loot storages, loot collecters and much more. All I could say supper cell great gob creating this game",5
"THERE IS AN ISSUE I AM EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. My accounts was automatically logout from supercell then, when I try logging in the verifications I received it says Incorrect verification code. I tried it with other email but it also says incorrect. Hoping you can fix this issue or atleast a response",1
The game is a base building game where you form a civilization off of attacking other players based and upgrading your own base.Your army can be so diverse and anything you can afford (not irl money)You will create friendships and experiences off of the game through clans.Clans are like groups of teammates who compete against other clans for rewards.There are endless amounts of strategies when you attack build or design your base.This by far is my favorite game as well as most strategic game.,5
Worst ever experience I have faced while playing this game after clan capital update .Whenever I try to open the game it always shows black screen. I am the user of this game since 2015 i've never faced any issues but after the new update of clan capital the game freezes and the whole screen turns into black...,1
"Great game totally addicting, I would suggest changes in the label of numbers, I sometimes get confused wether it's millions or thousands and end up spending more gold than I intended too, I would have to count every ""zero"" individually and it irritates me, so if you can atleast add spaces or coma in between the numbers that would be so very HELPFUL! <3",4
"Addicted game, I already played this game a while ago back on 2013 with no gold pass and it's really hard to level up and get some resources because there's no gold pass etc and events. But now it's easy to get loot because of gold pass and I started a new account last year and right now I am already in th10, superb game and addicting stress free.",5
This is a very special game. It immerses the player and at times I forget to take a break üòÖ. this game is so addictive and can pe played by anyone no matter their skill set.the graphic are excellent for such a compact mobile game. It is free to play aswell although I've spent some money on it. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. it is very fun and the player base is very friendly and the developers listen to the community. The game has gotten improved over time. truly a great game. 5/5 üôå.,5
"It's a pretty good game through and through, it is just something to spend your time on and check up on things, I recommend having two of their cames (ex. Boom beach, Clash of clans, Hay Day, and Clash Royale) something you can check up on now and then and it's good to have something in your day that give you something not look forward too. I had played the game before since 2013 and I have known about it since it came out and I loved every second of it. Keep up the good work.",5
I hate how you shove event/additional downloads in our face after opening the app! You made many people's internet slower and not getting their last minute war attacks! Idk why developer isn't thinking properly?! Not every player has access to blazing fast internet! Some players just have 100-200 KB/s internet out there! Open your mind & eyes!,1
"This is a good game and all but when you try to get your account back, they will literally ban you if you cannot remember things to a precise detail, like transactions over many years ago. Furthermore, we could have gone into another device and forgot about the previous one meaning, you will not be able to access your first micro transaction.",3
"This game is just too good. The idea of the game is great that you have to expand your empire,earn trophies, upgrade items and play clan wars... the only thing i dont like is the time it takes to make an upgrade Keep it up supercell. Brilliant gameüòäüòäüòä",5
"Clash, clans, and fun in general. Lots of things todo from campaign, clan wars, etc... most importantly being able to smite my enemies. I love the troops and what they've done with the game. I started on a different account around the 2010's and wizard towerd shot lightning. The game has changed a lot since then and I'm happy to play it.",5
"It's been a week but the crashing issue still persists. After loading, a black screen appears and then the app crashes. I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose my account so better update this game and fix all these crash issues as soon as possible.",1
I really like this game but now I can't open it for some reason that I didn't know. I starting to lose interest in playing it because whenever I open it my phone will stack up and it automatically go back to the home screen it's kinda annoying.,3
"I've been playing this game for a very long time, but one big issue has stood out to me for a while, The cost and amount of time to do things in the higher level town halls is SUPER high. I rushed my way to townhall 12 and have been trying to fix it FOR 2 YEARS yet I'm still not even close. I'm not sure how long I've been playing this game but it is it is probably 6-8 years. This game is fun at low level, But high level needs some love. Sincerely, (long time player) Landon323",4
"Its crashing a lot. Its not even opening. As the loading completes, a black screen appears and the game crashes. Plz fix this problem. I have reinstalled it many times but the problem isnt fixing. Thats why i rated it as 1 star. Humble request to all of you please fix this crashing issue. THANKS!",1
"Amazing game recommend it you can play with your friends and join each others clans the aim of the game is to build your base as strong as possible and upgrade your weapons, army and more. You can invade other people's base's and gain more coins and so to upgrade stuff. Over all great game and certainly recommend it. There is an example of it down below.",5
"This game is an absolute masterpeice for you're boredom! It has everything you need for just an amazing game! The one thing I think should change is the lack of creativity. I can see that all of the villagers have the same clothing, and hair. I'd really like to see how they could have different hair and different clothing too! And that could possibly go for walls too. Maybe some of the walls could be crooked. I think more creativity to your builds would be awesome! But this game is great!",5
"Really good game takes a while to get a high level and a good enough base but it's worth the effort you can play with friends, join clans, take parts in events and much more it is so additive to play and can play it when your out if you have enough data. You can never get bored although one bad thing about the game is it gets heavily expensive to upgrade your stuff and when you start upgrading you have to wait multiple days for it finish upgrading. Otherwise a very good game I would download it.",5
"I've played this game many times through my life and it's a good game, but it won't work on my phone, everytime I try to load it it closes the app, I've tried re-downloading it many times and uninstalling things, but to no avail. But the game itself is really good 10/10 would recommend",3
"I really enjoy this app. I just love how the battles play out, the different characters, the the gold and elixir obaintment doesn't hurt either. I would like it though if it was a little easier to get coins without spending money. Also, as it takes a really long time to level up buildngs without gems, it might be more enjoyable if building time maxed out at about an hour.",5
Been playing coc sense about a month after it dropped and have 2 accounts for it as well. The only problem I have with coc is creative looks. Like villagers and troops the only time troops get a change in cosmetics is when there upgraded which can take time theres a lack of cool events where you interact with other players it's just do challenges. It would be cool if there were game modes like 2v2 and you build a huge base to defend and a huge army to atk. Overall Great addicting/fun game.,4
"Great game to kill some time and if you're really into it there is a lot you could do in terms of strategizing and building a good village. I've personally played this game since 2013 on and off but I always find myself returning every year or so, the developers really did an outstanding job with this recent update.",5
I have been playing this for 17 days or 15 and I have a powerful base already like I have a lvl 7 Town hall and some lvl 3-6 walls and 2 lvl 9 Gold storage and some powerful stuffs and I'm stuck at 700-800+ trophies I kept loosing and winning by streaks or sometimes get lucky by attacking weak bases like I'm so much powerful than them sometimes. Thats it no bugs or problems I highly recommend this game even though its old.,5
This is one of the old games that i have been playing for many years but the thing that i notice is the problem of time taken by upgrades and this is my humble request to supercell to decrease at least 8% of time and all other things are awesome but the thing in battle of tropies that if i am attacking and there is 30 tropies on 3 star but i got only 1 star so i get about 10-15 tropies but if i defeated so there is no reduction in decrese in trophies. Thank you,5
"Amazing game, paved the way for others like it, uses amazing mechanivs and animation to keep interest. Would highly reccomend. The only problem i have is how much time everything takes, i understand that you cant have everyone completing it in a week, but 7 day upgrades are uneccecary.",4
"In my opinion I think of Clash of Clans as a great gameüòÄ. However I find it annoying that every time I launch the game, I find the game not loading up the scenery, buildings, or even defenses. This occurs on both of my villages and I am a player who spends abit of my money on the game every once awhile. I especially find it annoying when the game puts this dark empty background as the scenery whenever I want to change my sceneries. Please fix this cuz i am getting tired of this bug. üôè",2
The game was excellent. I had a made a quite huge progress within a few days. But after these recent update my game isn't opening. When I'm clicking the icon a black screen appears and my game crashes. I tried to contact with supercell with a help form but it didn't get send. So I'm here please fix this as I've made a huge progress and and I didn't want to loose it.pls fix it plssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss,1
"App is not working. Used to play a ton years ago, re-downloaded it last night and it was working. Woke up this morning and it says update available every time I try to open the app even though play store says it's fully up to date. I've tried force closing it and uninstalling the reinstalling multiple times and nothing will make it work. If I could give 0 stars I would. Absolute garbage. Fix the game supercell...",1
The game will crash after the loading bar goes about 10% of the way. After the capital update it appeared to have been fixed but has now reverted and is worse than before. I can't get in at all now. I have tried Reinstall Clear cache Restart phone Multiple devices Removed supercell IDs Delete chrome Updated android WV 2GB free Reconnected/different WiFi Latest software/game No Bluetooth No background apps I have contacted support several times to no avail. Why make it start crashing again??,1
"Have been playing this beautiful game. Have gone up in levels. Quiet addictive and you may end up losing money if greed takes over. However, I've seen in battles, most often the AI provides your opponents with more tha double ranking and you lose heavily. In case if you win, you may not gain that highly. So your tryst continues, but your progress ceases due to tougher opponents provided.",4
"Love the game, played it when th 10 was the highest and started playing again awhile back. I've enjoyed all the new content with th 11 - 14. I will continue to play as long as the game exist and even throw my $5 in each month for a gold pass. That being said imo I feel like this new update with the clan capital when be the start of the downfall of this game. Some may say it dropped off a long time ago and alot of people will disagree with me. I hope I'm wrong, I hope it continues to thrive.",5
"Game is good, Playing for over 6 years now, Recently I have encountered a bug. The game won't launch Most of the time, It takes 2 or three tries generally to launch the game. Less stars for this bug only, really annoying when you're on the clock and trying to make a quick attack during break or trying keep busy builders. For developers info I am currently using Galaxy S22 Please fix it I have also emailed Samsung India for this Issue as I don't have any other game i don't know if issue persists",3
"Still a great game and been playing it for like 8 years now and the app still great.There is still one that can help the game and I cannot argue with that. The model BK(Babarian King) should be restored from its second model revamp and I guess they can fix the matchmaking from BB(Builder Base) so the duel in that base so its little bit fair. But still love game its balanced, easy to relax, and great strategy game. Good Job Supercell!",5
This is the best strategy game I have ever played in my life. The graphics are sick and the controls are so smooth. But one problem I am having with the queen. sometimes the queen goes to the side even if I braek the wall in front of her. And the wall breaker also doesn't have that Al. so I will request to improve the Al of the queen and the wall breaker please.,5
I like the game and the new feature's are so coll is specialy how this is a strategic game and fun to play.How ever there's some glitch on the game like if you attack and your connection is lost you have to wait until your battle end's/when i attack and there's and slow signal the only deployed troop's before the signal is weak and you have to wait until the battle is ended agian. Plz fix this bug.,4
"So i was updated to the Clan Capital update yesterday. After update, i relize that the sound effect was change. From my experience is colecting Dark Elixir. The sound effect is regular Elixir sound effect that just slowed and lower pitch. And i found another bug that if i watch my replay from Builder Base. The theme sound are still played even i press Return Home button. And it all happen until today (even after i updated bug fix version). Please notice this and fix the bug. But the game was fun",2
"Great game, I really enjoy it. But a couple of things, like adding global chat, because you can really learn from other, and just make new friends. Also, adding something for the treasurey that lets you take however much gold/elixer/dark elixer you want would be very convenient. Other than that I recommend this game.",4
"Awesome game, what would be better to me is being able to share all resources within the clan, gold, elixir, dark elixir, magic items ect. Game tips flash while game is loading but youd need to read at an olympic level to read the message in 3 seconds or less. Mismatches happen frequently, would be nice if it was more fair. Also please add some type of credit for spending money that accrues and gives back to the customer, like a cash back reward does for a credit card.",5
"Fairly easy to play, fun and easy to get lost in the game...with the major exception of the ""Builder's Base"" and the ""Battle Machine"". It seems the Battle machine's AI is set to ""depressed suicide"" since it will walk past all weapons shooting it to attack a good mine of spider collector ignoring defense weapons and the Builder's hall. Been an ongoing issue ""Super Cell seems to ignore complaints about (what else do they ignore)",4
This game is perfect for people with patience and people that want to have something to do in your free time. When you get attacked you have a 12 hour shield but every time you attack it first takes away 3 hours then 5 the 7 etc. There is a bit of a pay to win aspect but it ruines the fun of building it up your self and you only get a bit of fun by doing so.,4
Very fun game there is a lot that you can do to expand your village in terms of buying new defenses and stuff and it is really fun to watch your village grow. Late game it takes a while to upgrade and build stuff but it is totally worth it once the upgrade is done and you realize how much it helps you,5
"This game hase excellent combat, strategy, and really cool graphics. One thing though, this one of those games where you want to play a little, do something else, and so on. (Mainly upgrades) I have played this for so long, I genuinely enjoy this game.",5
"I would to like to see new features like dark laboratory. It would be more help to many players. I have played this game for long time and I still face the same situation where I'm able to completely upgrade all the defenses expect for troops. It takes lot of time to upgrade troops and there is only one laboratory. We have to depend on the only laboratory to upgrade troops, dark troops, spells, dark spells. We really need this new feature soon. Thank you for the game we really enjoy it.",4
"I like the game, yes, the upgrades can take long as time and upgrades goes on, but that's what makes it great, because if there's a long upgrade, you'll find something to kill time while waiting for your upgrades, anyway, it's a great game and a good experience.",5
I've played this game on an off since it came out. I recently re-downloaded it and it will not let me make any purchases at all. Tried to contact Supercell an no response at all. Makes me regret spending money on the game on my old accounts. Tried to delete an re-download the game still didn't fix it. Maybe if some one from Supercell contacted me an corrected the situation I'd of left a better review. Would give 0 stars if I could've.,1
"Very fun game overall, I don't mind paying a bit for some convenience every now and then specially with the low prices that the games presents in its special offers. Best aspect of the game is the slow pace and time investment to achieve certain things and also having to outsmart the opponent's defenses.",5
"Cwl matching can become unfair, I can't imagine why there are no restrictions on having clans with far superior townhallls be matched with you. We had 2 wars so far and in both the enemy was very high level (not rushed as well) and in this one each mirror is at least 2 th levels higher (many are 3 and some are 4!). --- After this experience (and others) I don't recommend investing your time in this game, they don't care about you enjoying the game but on milking your wallet as much as possible.",1
"This is one of the best games ever it is so fun and I can't put it down but there is one problem the amount of time that it takes to upgrade buildings, supercell you could at least add more ways to earn gems in the early stages of town hall 4, 5, and 6 rather than just breaking trees and rocks But I give 5 star because it's fun",5
I don't like the troops sounds for this game not only home base but the builder base is even worse not only its sounds like someone waving a piece of paper but it sounds so unnatural and especially when using the battle machine's ability instead of the classic thunder noise you just hear a out of place noice that sometimes you don't hear I loved this game not only for tha gameplay but also for the unique sound effects. So please can you change all the sound effects back to the original sounds.,3
The best strategical game I've ever played. I love the game for sharp graphics and perfect gameplay tactics. The controls are smooth and easy. And hence this game is free to play. Switching of default base and builder base made the game interesting. This game is compleately worth playing.,5
"Ever since the new update my game crashes 9/10 whenever I try to load it up. Anytime I try to send a message to the clan or go to my builder base or the new clan capital my game crashes. I've tried making space on my phone clearing up ram, I've tried deleting the cache date I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it.. I've spent money on this game so it's kind of annoying that I can't even play it now. Also it's weird that you can get clash royal on your computer but you can't get this on PC",1
Its very nice game its been 3 long years since i started playing . I never had any problems in gameplay before but because of a certain glitch i am now unable to play properly . and now its been 4 to 5 months since this glitch showed up I thought it will be fixed after the update but now i can't open the game it keeps blacking out !! Supercell please fix my problem,3
"After the latest update, it looks like the game is using lower res textures for anything other than the heroes, such as buildings, walls, grasses, etc.. But I guess it's been fixed now. Many thanks!",5
Only the gameplay gets one because the build time in the game is too much from th 10 and above . I am the oldest player of this game round about 2 -3 year but just deleted the game due to the time was too much time for the upgrade but the game pulled me back my I'd is brockleyar and from friends group level 12 and enjoys playing it just the time makes me upset . Thanks for the best game,4
This game is honestly really good. It rarely lags and if it does its for 1-2 seconds. The gameplay and graphics are quite good as well. Some of the updates can be large for my phone to take and i have to uninstall other to play,5
Good game but its definitely a wallet grabber. I'd say the construction times need to be reduced by about 60%. Especially once you get to about TH 6. Also the resource productions speed needs to be doubled to accommodate the casual players since other players can steal about 1/4 of your resources per attack while offline. Other than that no further complaints.üòÄ,3
"Why no one plays this game anymore? Played the game a while back, around 2015. Tried installing and playing it again today. It started as a new village. Saved progress with Google was gone. No one can help. It's not even linked to the Google account. They won't admit it's an app issue. Twas a great game, til they can't solve issues nowaday. Support also takes a day to response, and that's they're chat support.",1
"What else can be said about this game, clash of clans is one of the greatest mobile games ever made from its funny and enjoyable commercial to its unique and captivating game play. Despite its main problem of upgrading time, this still remains entertaining with its mild events, additional content, and small campaign. It may not have large updates often but you can still find new ways to enjoy this incredible game. The best thing that really makes this game a masterpiece is no adds. 10/10",5
I really enjoyed this game. But one thing wrong with it is the player level system. I started not so long ago and now I'm TH7. And im getting players that are way better than me. And there's no way I can defend myself. Would definitely fix that and would start playing again.,3
"Can't lie, this game is on point, a great gateway to kill free times but one thing! ""Upgrading takes too much time"" ngl it'll be much much better if upgrading duration can be shortened. With that being said its a 4 for me . Overall, I'm satisfied with tha game ... ... ... ... ... ... After new update : ngl now this one's a sick update üî•, absolutely loved it! I have no issues other than tha massive amount of time/days gone in upgrading ... 'ppreciate it.",4
"The game is just as great as I remember, while it has obtained a slight pinch of pay-to-win due to waiting for buildings to finnish upgrading which takes forever, but apart from that the game is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of some intertainment.",5
"If they ask me, which game is the best mobile game you ever played, I'd say Clash of Clans, it's the best strategic game in my opinion, great graphics, developers are always working on new stuff and updates, it has no bugs no ads it's just perfect, I play this game for more than 6 years now and I never stopped playing it. LOVE IT.",5
"I love this game but the current issue that I've been facing in this app for almost a year is that when I started the app and stays in loading screen for five minutes and less and I get back at my home screen whenever the loading bar reaches at half the app starts to crash and yeah going back to my home screen again. Please do fix this, my device is really okay and can hold a lots of high storage games and my WiFi connection is okay too.",4
"This is one of the best games I have ever played. Less lag, can run in low end devices, good concept, and a child-friendly background. Strategy making is exellent too. I hope you all guys update the game with more features. I dont know what else to say about itüôÇ",5
"Game is free to play, has free items at times, does take a lot of times, has two main villages that are awesome to play, head to head in builder base and battles in main base, those who are struggling, I suggest YouTube for reference, this is not a pay to win game, all though you can, if you chose, go based on you're own strats, every card has a purpose, clan searching might need some work, because a lot have few active players, highly recommend game, for strategist, best of luck to new players.",5
"Great game, you can either slow roll your experience or pay to win... Periodic updates with introduction of new buildings, defenses, troops and levels keeps you on your toes. I've been in this game for years and still find enjoyment in it and the community, worth a try...",5
"After updating the game it becomes very lag even sometimes makes my phone freeze. not only on this cellphone, my friends also feel the same way. If this is a bug fix this as soon as possible as it is very annoying , Thanks.",1
Coc is one of the best addictive and interesting games ever...I have so many ideas for new updates and so on .. I think th 15 should have a futuristic looks like robot space ships flying by the side and the layout can have a purple theme it would be cool also we need a lab for dark elixir troops and spells separately cuz having only one lab isn't fair,4
Its an addicting game but they set you up for failure. If you're own it trying to gain extreme amount of trophies they will start making you loose every game. You can be 70 levels higher and have 10x the army and they will start making you loose. But then I tested this and spent some money and played for the same amount of time and endless wins. So technically its pay to win. Not a fan,2
"I find this a very fun game with great graphics and simple to play. This is my go to game to play online with people all over the world. The many updates add to the experience by constantly adding something new, and fixing up anything that needs patched. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good game.",5
"one of the best game in the mobile industry. basically, this game offers you a whole new strategic gameplay and requires you to squeeze your brain cells for a completely good attacks and defenses. 4 stars it is because the troops upgrade time are slow not like the building. my friend was just towhall 8 last month then, now he has a townhall level 9 this month, with full uprades of building but not the troops and spells.",4
"The builder base was bad, now you've added basically a mega complicated builder base. There is far too much going on now. Really disappointing that you keep tacking on these silly side bases when they should be an entirely different game. I'm sad to see my favourite game for the last 10 years become what it is today.",1
Love this game! Hope you can upgrade this game to make it more cooler! L have some ideas 1.ghost will summon ghost to attack the defenses they are mostly aggressive to the defense towers in the enemy's base 2.the ladder it's only used to climb over walls 3.distractor will distract all of the defensive towers in range (stun) Hope you like these ideas!,5
"Love the game I've been aying for a while but the only reason I'm 4 starring is because In the new clan capitol update you guys downgraded the graphics on towers and walls etc. And I am not liking that you decreased the attention to detail, I use to zoom in all the way to look at every detail and everything about my base but now I just don't want to so I doubt I'll be playing as much anymore sorry about the 4 stars but until it gets fixed I won't be playing because it just bugs me to much.",4
"COC, I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME SINCE IT STARTED. I play other games now because I got mad at this game (IT) for never helping me when I needed help but I see it's changed a lot but I never stop playing the game. I always log in everyday at least once and I still play because it is really fun. But I really wish y'all would explain this new update and yeah I would have just combined it with the dark base I loved the (Dark Base) instead of just leaving it there to die.",4
Very good but would like to suggest that please allow trade feature with other players. The trade items should contain some special military items for attack and defense purpose. Further every player should be able to produce military equipments to export with other players. Thanks for this excellent platform to spend some time calmly.,5
Overall this is a great game an absolute masterpiece but there is one problem for some reason when i am at the loading screen i get kicked out my internet is fine But it keeps kicking me out and ive tried reinstalling it and launching it but it keeps on crashing. Supercell can you please fix this ill change my review to five stars,3
"New update broke the game for me, ever since the new update (5-2-22) whenever I try to boot up the game it crashes before the loading screen even pops up. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times, restarted my device and cleared the cache and saved data multiple times to no solution to my problem. Every other game works just fine with my phone and this game did too I even played right before the update went live.",1
"Very bad addiction, think before you fall in it completely. It requirs a lot of startegies, if you don't know then its fine and good, but if you know to play then it may have a addiction which will require a strong desire to come out of this. THINK BEFORE YOU FALL IN IT - About the time management, because it will require a hell lot of time to max the levels up. About me - I even play at night. Overall 10-12 hours.. Minimum, even at exam times to take complete reward. HOW TO OVERCOME? ~Answer me",1
"Until yesterday, I can't log in, in COC. It always says Downloading content and then ""connection lost"" on loop. Our connection is very stable. I don't know what's happening. I've tried everything... I'm not gonna change the rating until it is fixed.",1
"Clash of Clans, a game that has built, upgraded and geared-up memories. Such a great experience to grow up with, a welcoming a friendly community and fun gameplay. Though it can take years to max your townhall and defenses, you're free to play in whatever way you want; Rush your base for new troops, spells and levels in order to attack others or upgrade everything gradually. The new Capital Peaks update is a grest way to unite clan members and leaders alike! Overall good execution.",5
"They keep adding more town hall levels and there isnt anything wrong with that, its good that they lower the building upgrade resource needs but supercell needs to lower the building time when they upload a town hall upgrade because in the higher town hall levels its really just frustrating to upgrade any building, it makes clan communication almost impossible because there is no need to open the game since all builders are on a 1 month cooldown i hope you guys fix the building time asap.",2
Been playing for around 5-6 years now. I absolutely love everything about this game there is never a bad moment. They should add a second builder for the night base though. A second one for everyone. not one that you have to unlock. But all around a very amazing game!,5
Insanely good game once you started. But once you got to the point that your base was good then it took SO long to upgrade you base. Also I don't like that if your base is really rushed at the start then you can't really make it not rushed because you are facing almost maxed out town halls that you are on so you can't get much coins or elixir. Another thing is that the game can be really pay to win in some ways loke the monthly thing you can get so much coins elixir and even books. Ilovethisgame,4
"Absolutely amazing. It is so much easier to obtain gems now than when I played a few years ago and there is more gameplay that can keep you occupied while waiting for troops to train and buildings to finish. The only problem I have right now is the sheer amount of bots- they join the clan multiple bots at a time and spam their malicious links... And because of the limitations on reporting, you can't report them in the speed that they come in. Will change to 5 stars if this is fixed.",4
"This new update with the Clan Capital is insanely epic, but I've taken a star away because a lot of the sound effects from the game have changed and that ain't it for me. For example, the roaster in the builder base sounds like a mortar continuously firing, the builders mech doesn't have the lighting noises when i tap his ability in battles, and cannon carts just sound awful now. Other than the sounds being different, amazing game",4
"Actually an amazing game if you can avoid buying in app purchases. It has plenty of fun free strategic gameplay, but be mindful of your wallet. If you want the best experience with this game, think about the journey along the way as you progress rather than trying to be fully maxed out. P.S. This game is a lot more fun if you're in the same clan as your irl friends",4
The game is ok. It just get me bored waiting for the upgrade it taking a lot of time. And there is an issue to attacking if you lost your connection i hope you can undo the moves or continue the attack when the enternet restored.,5
"best mobile game, you get to build up a village and make an army to take down other villages. Upgrading things may take a while but it's a very fun strategy game. You can pay to progress faster but everything is achievable without paying. No ads too!",5
"I know the way this game goes,they start easny, then every wall takes a million gold or elikcir and every upgrade takes a week. Gems are not cheap and I am 12 years old); And every build or upgrade takes so many gems .but the game is complected at a simple way wich is great üëç fun to play for a little while a day,and I don't have a big problem with the stuff above but if you're looking for a game to spend time this game is not for you.",4
From five star to 4 star. After the recent update i.e 2/5/2022 the game crashes and the graphic quality have become too poor and it looks too blurry. (If you try to zoom in) . So it would be better if the developer gives an update On the recent issues that all are facing in the game.,4
"Great game with lots of different buildings, troops, gold and elixir but those things take way too much time. It can take many hours, days or even weeks to get to build or upgrade certain buildings.",4
Good strategy game. Needs some work on being able to transfer loot between bases. Builder base maxes out quickly so you end up with nothing to spend your resource on. Would also be a good to be able to use dark elixir to up grade buildings and walls as well.,4
"I thought the the team is as good as the game but you all proved me wrong, day by day increasing the size of game i am unable to open the game it stucks between loading and closes everytime I gave you 5 star but edited review to 1 star you are loosing so many users by the same problem, react and repair it as soon as possible if you can. Useless team. Thank you so much for taking 6 years of hardwork.",1
"It's good I love it good graphics,fun games but I have a problem my th level is 11 and when I got online I got attack by th level 13 how!! Ofc my village will got roasted because the attacker is so strong it's ok if it's th 12 but 13 nah broo and one more can you delete the time if you upgrade hero or traps cause you need to wait lot of times just for 1 traps and the hero if you build it it's just nothing but if you upgrade it it will took so long plsss remove the upgrade time plssss thankyou!!",5
I love playing this game! It's hard to not want to waste gems on finishing an upgrade but sometimes I can't wait anymore. The only bad thing about the game is how long it takes to upgrade 1 thing when you are a higher Town Hall level.,4
"Good game very recommended. But it gets really annoying as a free to play. when you have got to wait days for it to actually upgrade expecially when there is only one of them and you have to go 3-10 days without that thing, for example the spell factory some of the upgrades are outrageous 5-10 days just for a spell factory",4
"This game is really awesome. Even though things can get slow at times, things are usually fast. You can actually fight other people. I know I don't like long tutorials, but this games tutorial is fairly short.",5
"The only improvement I want is of display. I have an elongated phone which makes difficult to see the entire base properly. On the other hand, on ipad it has no display issues. Please make it to fit to anysize display screen.",5
"This game was beautiful just as I remembered. Never gets me bored. Although, you could make 3 or 4 builders at the start. The amount of gold it takes to upgrade town halls is excessive. It would be great if we could get Clan recommendations near my region. Very nice game, always keep us gamers happy.",4
"This game is great! I would totally recommend this to any supercell players and players who love strategy, this has to be by far one of my favorite games on mobile, I play it daily! Any people who love a challenge, strategy, and who like games that aren't pay to win. I can tell you I'm Town Hall 8 and haven't paid a dime, I know thats not a huge town hall but still. Upgrading takes time, so if you don't have patience(that's just sad if you don't have any patienceüòï) then this is not for you.",5
I love the game hands down the best for me it does take time to upgrade but you can cahllenge friendly people and you can get way high up in trophy's for me upgrades are like 14 days but that's fine because its a game that u don't have to be on 24/7 to get better you can go play other games while something's up grading and it does it in real time it's not a speed up game it's awesome,5
"Been playing for a looking time, many years but recently have found I'm losing interest. I thought long and hard about what can save the game from players like me- is innovations! I'd be curious to explore another land, aquatic adventures and sea animals",2
The targeting ai is confusing but also effective and the animation is good and it really takes up a lot of time so be ready and the suggestion of the community actually gets through all in all its a great experience originaly in 2014 it was quite revolutionary and looking back at it i can see that it has grown a lot and for the better,5
The game is amazing but lately it keeps saying server error and restarts over and over again and u need diamond to progress and it's impossible to get them unless you spend money on them don't get me wrong they are affordable and cheap but it would be nice if they had events where you can win them as prizes or something close.,3
"I have to disconnect my supercell ID because a stranger is threatening me. He had my account in his mobile. But I am unable to disconnect. A msg ( Unfortunately, we're unable to disconnect Supercell ID from your account at the moment. This can be due to several different reasons, for example, if you have irregular login sessions or if your account has been recently recovered. Please try again after a while. ) will appear.

After i update the apps last night to latest version it works find but when i woke up this morning and try to open the apps the problem started it wont open and always force close. I've already uninstall and reinstall the app same problem happen. I have a stable connection and ive already clean my ram and other files to make way for coc app to run smoothly but same problem it wont open and forced closed. Any advice or tips on how to trouble shoot this apps guys. TIA,5
it keeps disconnecting. even during attacks. i turned off notifications but i still get notifications. it says there is update and i cant play till i update. i come to the playstore and it doesnt show any update. i have upgrades going and its a waste of time to check all the time for an update that isnt there. the game is unfair. if you are not in a clan your progression will half speed.,1
This game has stood the test of time for mobile games (for me to have stuck with one) and has had a lot of new things added to it to keep it interesting for long time players. Pretty fun but the only things I can say is NERF THE ROASTER and make smarter attacking NPCS.,5
"Even though it's graphics are good and the game has no ads, the game isn't very enjoyable. You always get attacked by stronger players who have way better troops then you and I get opponents who's bases are way to hard to attack. Also, half stars would be great. Once I got 97%, and still I only got 2 stars and missed out on one whole star.",2
Pretty fun. A game a can constantly look forward to playing. Only annoyance is when you get far enough in it takes like 3 days of doing nothing waiting for your stuff yo upgrade. I see why this is the case though and just live with it. Overall fun game.,5
"It's good! My sister plays it almost every day. If you have patience then this is the perfect game for you. Its just... It needs more options like more troops. But overall, its a good game for chilling. The problem I have that it is very laggy. Could you kindly try and fix this please...?",3
"Been playing this game since day one, I'm not maxed because I don't spend all hours of the day on it but it's definately a great time passer. Love the graphics and creativity. Maybe less upgrade time would be great but still an awesome game.",5
"I dont play games much but since ive found this one ive played more than ever before. Very well put together and thought out. No other game has such a great plan besides clash Royale! Love that just as much! The creators are involved i can see with updates, and always working to add new ideas. Thanks to the team for making a place i can escape to from lifes stressful situations.",5
"This game is an old favorite of mine. This was my introduction into mobile games when I was a kid, the first game I downloaded into my old tablet I got for Christmas. And after all this time the game has kept under constant updating, changing with the times and evolving further while still keeping the same charm it had 8 years ago.",5
"I like the game. Strategic as well as challenging. I stopped playing this game for quite long time at th 13 and planning to play again but for some reason my phone cant load the game, everytime i open it, upon reaching around 70% loading, it just kicks me out. Im using vivo btw.",2
"It is a great game, my favorite mobile game. But my only criticism about it is the Season bank loots. Just after every season, the season bank would fill the resource storage and have always hard times using it, esp. when u th11-higher. Most of the time the season bank would go to waste as the CWL would also start right after the season-end. The developers should create a separate loot storage for the season bank (like the cc treasure) where we can claim the loots when we actually need them.",4
"Great game, but the update experience is bad. I was in a war, and I wanted to quickly build my armies. I was busy with real life. I had to sit through some stupid tutorial. I didn't learn anything, because I was in a hurry. Now that I want to see the tutorial, I can't because I clicked through it quickly when I didn't want to see it. Please make those cutscenes optional.",5
"The game is designed to be F2P friendly if you are consistent. There are many different troops, spells, heroes, etc that one can use. The game has lot of strategic depth with army building, base designing and choosing upgrades. 9.5/10",5
"I would rate this game a five star, but you know, nothings perfect! I would suggest making the upgrades a little faster, but other than that, its great! Also, a targeting system for attacking would be nice",4
"I've pla] for years across many accounts, the game began to die when the upgrade times went to over 2 - 3 weeks and personally I stopped playing the game for a whole year, but this clan capital update has brung a reason to play and log in but fun not boring. This update made the game what it was 3 years agoüòä 5 stars keep it up supercell (how long do we have to wait for clash mini?)",5
"Thanks supercell,the update is awesome üòé,before that my Phone sometimes having a frame drops üò≠, it's like update new things,but the game is not heavy anymore is smooth running on my phone now,and that's what I like, graphics sounds and the way it's look, it's like nostalgic to the old player likes me",5
"I'm trying to continue playing on an old phone, but this update doesn't let me. It's forcing update without an option to skip. And the update screen only had the options ""Uninstall"" & ""Play"", so even the app recognizes that this device don't be able to upgrade. So why am I being excluded from this world, just because I have an old device for it?",1
"Well at first I thought this was a very hard game since I saw the cost of all types of obstacles, and it was super expensive then I turned into TH5 it was a piece a cake you know. I hate it when the troops don't attack my prioritized building especially defenses, I wish Clash of Clans fix this by adding something in the settings. Also, I think that the Robot (Hero in Builder Base) is the dumbest hero of all time like he is so big but is dumb sometimes you feel me like when he attacks the guards.",4
"I, personally, am not a fan of the Clan Capital feature - it seems broken/confusing and needs to be either removed from the game completely and turned into its own game, or completely revamped to be less confusing and more intuitive/enjoyable.",2
"Old, but not necessarily bad, wait times for things are still a little long but there have been some major fixes to keep the game playable. Rn, my biggest complaint is the app will not open without being updated, but the play store says there isn't an update...",4
"Great strategic game, large variety of troops to use, and it's too expensive to buy your way through which is nice because it allows for actual gameplay. I've played it for 6 years and it has only gotten better since.",5
"This is best game I've ever played. I have made a lot of progress in this game, allover i'm not much good in strategy making games. But, now I am addicted of this game a lot. I play it whenever i touch my mobile. Even while studies, I think about it. But, the thing I don't like is it's network connection üòï , my network always runs much faster than any of my family phone, but still it doesn't connect it well. So, please supercell, fix it. üôè. BTW I love this game.",4
"Ive been playing forever it seems like, the game is really fun. I think It would be really cool if you guys would add a mode where you can attack your own base to practice and see what you can do better to defend your town.",5
"The game was good but it has issues and problems after the recent update, i updated my archer tower last night and when i woke up, it didn't upgrade!! I'm so furious and mad, i waited for 11 hours for nothing, this incident happened to me not once but TWICE, please fix it!.",2
The app keeps on crashing on my redmi 7A. Total black screen with audio only. Everytime I need to re-open in order to play again. Other heavy games (i.e. mobile legends) are just working fine and running smoothly. Only this app keeps on crashing.,1
"Simple strategy game. The only reason I took off one star was because of a lack of a challenge at later levels. But other than that its a well set up and enjoyable game. I would reccomend it, espesially if you like strategy games but aren't the strongest strategy player.",4
"The game is super addictive, I'm hooked. However after the most recent update I am frustrated. The time remaining on my townhall update was 4 hours Remaining. Did the update and 14 hours now remains. Not only that, but I no longer have dragons and the robot guy upgraded time restarted.",3
"Been playing for years but app broken now since last update, when I open it a message says update available but no update is available in store. When app store is opened it just says play where update button should be. Update if your having this problem also close app, force stop app, clear apps catche, and restart device. This worked for getting update download started.",5
"Awesome game, I love every concept. I like hopping on and doing upgrades and sometimes spend a long time doing other stuff such as raids, and it is totally different than all the other moblile games which I love. Keep up the good work",5
One of the best game I would have ever played . Nice strategic intersting and adventurous game . Only one thing is that the time required to update things at higher townhall is too much . But still not a big deal . Would like to see more events in the game,5
"it's all good until the recent update. game graphics just became lower, building looks blurry, builder hall grass looks weird, and some sound effects are different. I'm playing on Xperia XZ1, which is still quite strong for gaming these days with it's Snapdragon 835 chip. I think it may be caused by the game optimization? Can you guys fix this please?",4
"Love the game so much, eventhough I started playing like 2 month's ago, the fact that this game is very popular is that the animation, game aspects, and etc. are just very beautiful. And btw, what happened to the uodate, the graphics kinda blurry and I hope you guys fix it ASAP",5
"THE GAME IS VERY GOOD I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR 7 YEARS. Alot have change, the things you added is very good, like the town hall 14, Clan capital, BUT!........when you zoom any base to the max it's kind of blurry unlike before, and the zone where you can't put your troops when attacking is blurry too. I hope you can fix it, ANYWAYS THIS GAME IS AMAZINGüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè",5
Been playing this game for more than 8 years now... Awesome strategy game. Its just that we need to have a lot of patience for everything in this game. I suggest try reducing the upgrade time for every building and every troop.,5
Base on my experience this is a very difficult game because you to make sure your plan on how to attack and how to build your troops and then my experience there are two types of attack first is ground attack and air attack. Ground is very difficulty plan it depends on your enemy map of what is the style of the map your going to attack and the air attack is not exactly hard but plan deeply also for making a victory and you get a three star and that's all my experience thank you and God bless,5
its great playing this game i myself play whole clan..so the improvements needed-: 1)whenever we friendly challenge someone he should be able to customize his clan castle reinforcement too so as he can try cool stratagies.and... his heroes should work in friendly challenges even if they are on upgrade.. 2)since you wont bring back the global chat i just want you to improve the player finding system i invite tons of them but nobody comesüòë... thats the word limit i guess thank you!üíñ,4
Many clashes are way to difficult. It is also difficult to add more troops. Very time consuming. Game is moderately fun. User interface could be better. Cost and expenses are decent priced some are over priced. Nothing in terms of loyalty bonuses or daily bonuses. Some defenses are ridiculously difficult. Overall the game can be made easier. Turn over because of cost or difficulty is normal.,2
"Well, Clash of Clans is a nice game to play and build a clan. It has lot's of integrated features to play with friends and enemies. I started playing this game almost 6 years ago. The game is really addictive and one of the best game to play around. It has lot's of clan strategies such as defense, attack, troops combination, research, upgrade, storage, and many more to play with. I really enjoy playing this game. I suggest people to play this game. üôè",5
"Awesome update, but since downloaded and run/opened once and now it won't open a second time, continues to constantly force close. Have to delete and reinstall every single time I want to open CoC. Fix please!!! Been playing for 8 years at least!!",1
"I love the game its fun and I like to battle, but the thing I dont like is how long the wait time for the buildings to upgrade, it could be at least at very high townhall levels could be at least 2 days and at in between townhall like town hall level 9 which I am at that townhall. Anyways, it could be at least 1 day per upgrade like around there",4
"The game is very good and addictive but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because of a bug. After this clan capital update came, it is kicking me out of the game after two or three battles and when I login again my trophies are deducted and my troops also gone. I really like this game so pls fix it.",4
"I always love this game, but one day I decided to quit this game because some of the boys doesn't play COC anymore, but when I installed it again, it's a surprise that my troops and buildings are upgrading continuously, I don't even had an Archer Queen but now I already have and it's already level 11. May 1, 2022 I'll never forget this day. HahaüòÇ",5
"I love this game, I've been playing it for many years and it's overly addicting. After the last balance update the game has started stuttering (newer model phone) so it's four stars until then. I still honestly love this game and will continue to play it, the community is seriously special.",4
In my opinion not a great game but best for playing in low network and low end device... I played since 6-8 yrs ago and thats awesome there are lot of new features added like scenery theme new heros with lots of skin and continuously updates and new events... Thats awesome but now the time there are lots of games but if you ask for which game is best in low size for low end devices and played well in low network... Then I recommend this game‚ù§Ô∏è,4
It's one of the my favorite game. Since i am playing from 2016 onwards but now more difficult to built a clan and play and to maxx also it takes 3-3.5years it's too difficult so I requested to the team please reduce the time otherwise no one interested many my friends also didn't play this game because of this time issues...........üôè,5
"Definitely love it. Suitable for all ages, never lets you get bored, awesome gold passes with beautiful skins, tremendous updates including necessary mechanics, support center is best, whole team of Coc is doing great job to make such a Great Game! (This is not a paid comment) It's the real thing that I and most of the coc lovers will say after having such a wonderful experience with this game. It seems boring to wait for the upgrades of buildings but trust me, you won't regret the outcome üòâüëç",5
"The game is phenomenal.i have been playing it for 3years and yet i can't get it enough.there is plenty of things to keep one busy.. upgrading defences,heroes,pets and levelling up troops in the lab whilst taking part in clan wars for loots and xp and clan war league for war medals by which one can buy many things to progress a base way faster.this game is,as mentioned, phenomenal.i truly appreciated the game creator for bringing up such an amazing game and hoping to see game more",4
"Fantastic game, i like how your base get for fashionable and better as your upgrade (yes it may take A LONG TIME but its totally worth) the graphics are really nice, and the form of combat is different from any other game allowing you to use different troops for different situations. Onr thing i did wanna mention is that you guys are awesome dont know if its you guys or google play giving me free bundles but i love and thank you guys so much it really helps me uprgade my base",5
"I enjoy playing this game for the week or so I've played it. My only gripe has been that the way the game plays is based on you constantly waiting. It's fine at first but it's a game that demands your attention but with that system it also forces you to constantly wait unless you spend gems. It's strange how it works, but when you get past that it's an amazing game honestly.",4
"Very much fun to play. Some people think that upgrades take a lot of time, but trust me, there is a lot to do while they are upgrading. After reaching Th 9 the real game starts. That's where a lot of things change.",5
GREAT GAME I have been playing this game for years and its 1 of the best games I've ever played. The upgrade times take an extremely long time but if it where any lower you would be able to get to max lvl in a week or 2. If that where to happen it would no longer be fun. Anyhow this game has been great since 2013.,5
"My favorite game ever, it's so cool and I will tell you why, 1 its mobile friendly bc I'm on a tablet and it works well, 2 so many unit to choose from and keeps on adding more instead of a limit of units and the game will be predictable, and 3 (the best one of all) ITS GENDER EQUIVALENT both male and female characters play a strong role, keep it up Supercell!",5
"I have faced a issue , I tried to sign in with my supercell I'd for first three times . entered the wrong OTP by mistakenly. After that I have tried signin again but Otp did nt come to my email . In ui there is no resend option . It seems like bug . Other that it is amazing game",4
"This game is now touching the new heights, from recent times it experiences great changes in it. And now more and more players are playing it with interest because now it works in its worst areas and it works it's best to improve themselves. Really now this game is coming with new ideas and expectations. I really want to appreciate their hard work! Keep working! üëçüòá",5
This game is great. Even though you need time to strengthen your base it's still fun experience. And the amount of relief you'd experience in getting your base max is just like solving a Rubik's cube for the first time.,5
"I love this game but it has a major drawback and that is it's network system....though i have a very good internet connection,it lags and signals bad network sign! Furthermore,during every CWL,it's server gets down and the game lags... It doesn‚Äôt connect to internet after opening it and keeps signalling bad network sign... Irritated with this!",1
"The game is time consuming and it's definitely not for everyone unless you're willing to put the time and effort into getting far (or money I suppose for some people). It could and would be better if the devs would just cave already and bring back global chat. The game is nearly dead as is and clans need a way to recruit any new players, and the game just doesn't have a solid system for that anymore since global chat was removed.",3
"This game was good.Then come the freeze problem in game when l opened event section in game.Then come this new update recently.The lag and freeze problem is solve the game is running smoothly but the sound quality and graphics quality is too poor.I am not satisfied with this sounds and graphics.I can't enjoy the game like before.those old sound, graphics was far better. I am so disappointed.Hope you will fix these.",2
"I want to rate it 5 stars because I really love this game. But my concern is, it won‚Äôt open no matter what I do. It keeps on saying ‚Äúcan‚Äôt connect to the internet/server‚Äù, but my internet is working perfectly fine. This happened after the update. Please fix it and I will change to 5 stars. Thanks. Edit: Here‚Äôs the 5 starts. It‚Äôs already fixed. Thank you!!!",5
"I really like the game and the new update no serious complaints Although the new clan capital has a network issue for me. Playing clash of clans normally my network is fine but as soon as I start attacking on the clan capital the network deman becomes way to high. Not sure if this is a fixable but,I really want to play clan capital properly but every time I do it lags and I have to restart clash. I use a Samsung A51 if that helps",4
"Since the townhall 14 update I've been experiencing many crashes when logging in. Up to 9x, 14x, in a row. I'm not exaggerating. When I log on clash and go to wizard valley the game crashes everytime. Supercell, I'm a really big supporter. Can you guys please investigate the crashes",3
I'm really enjoying this game i have been playing this game for 2 to 3 years i really like the concept but when i stated playing this game for first time the upgrade building time make me mad and started loosing hope but eventually i used to it so the upgrading time doesn't make me mad now the only suggestion is to reduce the cost of the items in shop the price of the gold pass is ok but the shop's items cost is quite large plz consider to reduce it.,4
I like the game. Things just take to long to progress unless you pay. Even then the amount of gems to progress is ridiculous. But stupid people will continue to pay I guess. Just sucks these game get so slow to where you start searching for something new like I am in the process of doing. But the strategy aspect is cool here.,2
"Great game. I just have one problem, it sometimes will get stuck on the loading screen and say downloading content. I've done all the steps and tips to fix it and none of it worked. But I still recommend it.",5
"Great game to play here and there, I don't always feel like battling but it doesn't hinder you much by not playing for periods of time. Your base will be right how you left it, minus a few trophies üòÇ",5
Guys sos !!! After the new update you cant play the game with wifi cause it reloads all the time. Its very annoying because it happens in the middle of the battle and you waste a lot . Please do something!!!!!,5
"Really great game that gives us regular updates with various creative features such as editing your base layout , build your base stronger and tougher . Also events with various challenges, clan wars and clan war leagues, and especially their monthly clan games and also many more features of troops,heroes and spells etc,. Make this game look absolutely nice.ü§©ü§©",5
"updated version not working properly on android phone , whenever i used to load the game it shows dark screen and after that the game become stoped. please fix the loading problem. i am using the game since 3 years but from previous update loading problem become a issue and now on latest updated version it totally failed to load the game.",2
The quality of the game is fair but I hope I can give my resources to friends and clanmates thru donations or gift giving. The upgrades are quite too long and it's a waste of time. I hope they could make adjustments so waiting time won't make us impatient . I've been playing this game and there's no adjustments since then. Looking forward to better updates .,3
"Clash of clans is a city building game where you can create your own village, but instead of buildings and houses it's weapons. LOTS of weapons. Anyways it's fun but does get boring because you do the same thing over and over again and when you level up your town hall you get some new weapons and you can upgrade Futher so I don't play it a lot anymore and it relys on skins and season passes to be fun and I don't even like the session pass's so I give it 3 out of 5.",3
The New update made the image poor. The HD of the image is gone. I would like to have the image as it was. It is uncomfortable to see the screen when the pixels are so obvious,4
"been playing for a long time. It's a time killer that's for sure. New update won't work for me though. Says to update the game then when it opens up play store in don't have the option to update. Only ""play"". Which then reopens the game which prompts me to update. Round and round we go.",5
It's a fun game at the start but after you go up a few town halls it gets really time consuming and it makes the game less fun because while I have upgrades going I generally don't get on till it's done and that's really the only problem,3
"i have seen the new feauture above the sky. i was disapointed when i was not able to edit the map in capital peak because i was not a co-leader, it would be ok and undestandble if it was easy to type what exactly i want to change but i wish for a new role( like elder,co-leader etc ) but specilised for capital peak alone say name it as the ""engineer"".",4
"I started playing this game with my nephew on Christmas day about 8 years ago. It's a great game, made alot of cool connections from ppl all around the world. All through a simple app game. It's enjoyable and cool to see how it has evolved over the years. My advice is dont rush your village town halls. Upgrade everything gradually. Rushed villages are the worst to defend once higher level villages attack you.",5
"Hey Supercell, I'm expiriencing a huge promblem, When I'm attacking and I started deploying some troops later on Lost connect occur even though my internet is stable. Its really really makes me mad co'z im not finish my attack. That's happen to me every single day. From champlll to masterll i've lost alot of trophies. So Please! Fix that",5
"Been playing sinne before th9 came out. It was the first Halloween update. Had like a 6 year break, kuten now with Hard grind and wise monet spending has gotten me in 1 year 3 months to th14 halfway max. Handsfree down the best mobile game there is and almost the only one I play and actually enjoy it. If your new to the game, keep grinding and when you get to th9 things come alot more complicated, attacks multi stage. I don't reccomend free to play atleast buy the gold pass.",5
"Good. But I always hate the after update loading of the game! It takes so much time! It will exit a few secs then need to reload again. It will go on almost forever until the DL content goes through continuously. Right now dated May 2 PH time. It says there is a new version available giving a link to update but it goes to the google play.There is no update button. Only uninstall and play!Should I uninstall first then reinstall to get the update done???Fyi, the auto update is enabled.",3
Love this game. FIX IT. I can't get on it. Fix it please. Keeps saying there is a update but there is no update! I want to play it but I can't due to it constantly this morning it wants a update but for frigen update! I'm on everyday if not every other day. This is the only thing that helps me relax at night! I've tried to uninstall and reinstalled it still telling me there is a update! F I X I T!,3
"After the latest update, it made me and my clanmates frustrated because loading the game now has become a big problem even with high quality 4G network we cant load it, even if it load the wifi signal appear and cant do anything until it says Network error... Please fix this problem as soon as possible as we are in clan war leaque so that we wont miss any attack..",4
"Amazing game! Having soooo much fun with it. One problem is, idk if its my device or what but every time I open the app it crashes. Every thing just goes black and I have to close the window and restart it and hope it works. And when it does work, I try to go to the builder base and it crashes. Like I said, idk if its just my device or what, but if it isn't, could plz fix it? :) (this an edit) hi, my issue has been fixed, prob because of recent updates. Thank u so much!",5
"Very good game, played since i was little and had seven different bases. Good game, many updates. Always patching bugs. Always been a good game, still is. I highly reccomend. (Tip: Max out base before upgrading townhall) Trust me, it helps.",5
"Good game but is when you get higher up (townhall 10+ and builder base 9) the game gets boring as everything takes to long, the battles don't earn you enough money to even fund your army half the time. The builder base battles are even worse, I use max level battle machine and max level troops and struggle to get 70%, and 2 stars occasiobly if I'm lucky.",3
"Years of my life free time has been repeatedly entertaining. Sending challenge is like free practice, helping me reestablish my approach point ""via Spawn points"" Strategic planning for base development, troop upgrades, and attack troop deployment. These growth opportunities are available for me everytime I am online. Simply log on for few minutes, Select upgrades, and destroy stuff fast. Most days log on same times consistently so other players know when we help each other, donate, challenges üòÄ",5
"Its a fun game, it's really hard to upgrade walls though, I'm stuck on level 2 walls, but other than that, it's a fun game! UPDATE: I upgraded my storages, so now I can buy up to level 6 walls!",5
"Nice game ,nice experience but there should be some changes , for example, townhall levels are increasing but builders are not,therefore takes ultra time. moreover, Facebook login doesn't really works but Google play login works,which is a good thing but the above mentioned things should be managed to get 5 star rating. Overall good performance by supercell",4
Give back the original soundtracks dammit...all the buildings and turrets sound are pretty much the same...even the troop and spell deploying sounds became pretty bad...those are one of the most pretty things i enjoyed in the game...its so annoying now...üò†üò†,2
Perfect game if you like grinding but the only thing I don't really like is that a level 5 mortar takes longer then a day to upgrade even though a level 11 cannon does not take a single day and with the mortar the damege only goes up by one or two and it's not really good until It gets too level 8 but the designs are really cool too see my favorite is the town hall 9 lab,4
"I haven't been able to really get into this game. After building a couple task, I got stuck because the storage full at the start and it takes too long. I don't know if I'm going to catch or if it's requiring to use gems that I have to to keep buying to do the basic tasks. I'm still working with it for now.",3
"After the update of the clan capital, when I open the game, it lags and then exits on its own when I try to re open it, it repeatedly says that ""network error"" but I can play wildrift normally... Please fix this if this is somehow the apps problem.",2
"Been playing this game with my dad since I first moved away to college so we could play something together. We still play just about every day and he's already lapped me a few times leveling up his bases. We have lots of friends in our clan & have made new ones over the years. Anyway, fun game to give you something to do, but not have to dedicate all of your time/real money to do well or have fun.",5
I can't purchase Gold Pass through LOAD or SMART COMMUNICATION it says I don't have enough balance amount but I have enough Load balance to purchase it. It was okay the last but this month of June it just can not. I already redo it over and over but still I can't. Please Guide and Help me supercell. Thank You!,1
I have been playing this game since 2012 until now. I didnt every seen any game this like. Super stratagy game.A amazing graphics you have and good comrades you have found on this game. Like a battle ground all the clan members have choose a better strategy to defeat the enemy in war. It's just like a mind game and Teamable game. Without any comrade you can't play Anything.,5
"I really like this game and the new update is awesome but there is only one thing that is whenever I try to got to barbarian camp or some other district game is just completely gliched and i have to quit to reset it, I know this is an big update. so, problem like this happen but i just don't want it to go unnoticed soooo, plzz",4
The worst update ever... The app doesn't work.. It hangs.. Attacking malfunctions...the screen becomes black while attacking....it takes up so much space.... It's the worst... Fix it right away please .. Still haven't fixed it.... Where is the administration?!?,1
"It was Great before the update but now that you update it now it's not really the way I liked it and it's not good buildings don't make noise anymore,troops sound different,the new features I don't really like them because they will take a lot of time to also upgrade,if you can atleast change some of the new features for the old ones it would be good üëçAgain it's good, only the new update it change and I kinda don't like it.",4
"The game is good, but it keeps crashing on the load screen. Rarely does it get past the 70% mark, and when it does, I give it twenty minutes before it crashes and closes. I know it's not an issue on my phone because I used to play on it, and I also went through every Support website and did everything instructed, including factory resetting my phone. It'd be wonderful if the dev team fixed this issue!",3
"Great Game, Helps to develop startegy and implement the Plan in our mind for the great victory. Super addictive. Upgrades make more time that's the only negative thing. Make the Strategy and Go to battle!",5
Over all a great game but it seems to be based around money because everything takes so long to build. You need gems coins and elixirs for everything if you want to get anywhere in this game your going have to spend money and it's going cost an arm and a leg. You could easily spend 20 for 2500 gems and use them in less than two minutes just to upgrade one thing that takes a week to upgrade. Only complaint is it should have better deals. Game it's self is a masterpiece and very addictive....,4
"Love this game. Been playing for 10 years and MOSTLY it keeps getting better. BUT, after tons of updates and still nothing new in the builder base, I have to edit this and take away a couple stars. You guys introduced this huge new clan capital but nothing in builder mode?! PLEASE UPDATE THE BUILDER BASE! I really enjoy the builder base but clearly supercell doesn't care about their little stepchild anymore. Any update, no matter how small would be greatly appreciated. Throw us a bone man!",3
I love this game and have benn playing for years but recently i got a computer and it wont let me play on it everytime i open the app it instantly crashes and i dont know how to fix it. If supercell could fix this issue i would for sure give this game 5 stars,3
"I am done now. This game is full of bugs and glitches. My game not opening, Everything is ok till loading after loading the game turns to fully black screen. Just hear sounds and music but screen not working for this game. Plz fix it quickly, because I am a leader of a clan and I only person who manage 50 playersüòû",1
"I upgraded my townhall to level 11 but there are some bugs, for example The dragons of max players should be max or for me it should be 6 but I don't know why it show me the level of both 5! Let's fix the bugs for me. Thanks a lot.",3
"There's a reason this has stuck around for so long. User experience has improved immensely since it first hit big, the earlier town hall levels go fast. I'm sitting at Town Hall 12, only been playing on this account for I'd say about a year. They're -still- adding new features, with the Clan Capital having gone live a week or so ago. Only complaint is the monetization, but even with that, Supercell has made it friendlier - it's very easy to get free premium items via Clan Games, for example.",5
"This is one of the games that tests your patience. First of all the matchmaking doesn't care if it pits you against someone a full townhall higher than you. So what if they have better defenses and units that you dont have access to yet, it doesnt care, get slaughtered, over and over and over again. And eventually it take weeks to upgrade things. If you're a masochist and love the idea of finishing a game 30 years from now then this is the game for you.",2
"I absolutely love this game, it's brilliant. I think that the upgrades for lower level stuff take for ages lol. ALSO to stop people from rushing their bases maybe add challenges for each town hall that must be completed before you move onto the next, maybe starting at TH5?",4
I used to like to play this game a lot but after sametime I noticed that in night village was control because I can predict whether I am going to win or lose as if you win 2 war you will lose 3 time and sametime 1 win and 2 lose and it will continue same though out the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My townhall is level 8 but I get townhall 10 and 11 as my opponent!!!!! OMG!!!!! I am starting to hate this game now.,2
"I have tried many times convey my problem within the game but it always show me a message that is unable to load my previous village although I have given all the information correctly. The main problem is that I haven't connected my account to supercell,I have connected it to Google Play games but I have lost all my achievements so my previous account also lost in clash of clan .Please help me in recovering my old village againüôèüôè",1
I open the app it says good news! A new version is available. But upon clicking the update button and going to playstore it doesn't have an update button for updating only uninstall and play. I can't open and play the game! It is not good but a bad news,5
"The waiting 3 days to craft capitol gold is ridiculous. You put hard caps on new features. So it will takes years to complete. Getting capitol gold and upgrading the capitol in the most boring way possible. I was interested at first but logging back on, realize how boring it is.",3
"one of my favorites games,it contains a lot of troops and spells a to make different strategys,multiple defences towers,and many super troops and kings,my only two problems here that members of some recommended clans never join game or they stoped playing it which effect the other members,so i'd like to see an update which the leader of clan will be changed to an active member after a sertain amount of time of not connecting,and for some reason when i start the game,it shows a black screen ,help",4
"I just started playing and my builderhall is on level 4 When playing in versus my competitor's builderhall is on level 6-7 the match making is very uneven.. Upsetting. How in the world is bh4 going to compete with a bh6-7? And in versus and multiplayer sometimes it's not giving me trophies.. After a versus battle I still can't wrap my head around it, my score was 2 stars 76% destroyed time left: 2:24 and my competitor's was 2 stars 69% destroyed time left 2:32 and they won!? THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!",1
"Absolutely a very good game but in game some problems are occurring. There is a very big change in our game. Like the cake,spell,boat etc have a change in sound effect.",1
U was attracted to this game since both my parents have been playing this game since I was born so I had to try it myself and I rushed things until my parrnts told me great tips that brought me niw just recently downloaded it and Im getting the hang of it. I like the fact that you can just leave the gane 24/7 waiting for things to upgrade unlike other games that needs much attrntion 24/7.. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê for SUPERCELL,5
"I like the game, but recently when I try to load up the game it, the loading screen pops up then crashes or right after the Supercell logo it crashes. I still get Village notifications but I can't get into the game.",3
"This is an amazing game I've had it for about 4 or 6 years basically my childhood safe place, the graphics, experience, troops, base everything is absolutely phenomenal, worth it and free! I 100% recommend it.",5
I like this game very much I have small bse in this game. I love playing this game so much. It is non addective and very simple game. My brother also play it. This very good game. But there is a glitch that when I play the game the game got stuck but sometine it gets jut got out to the how screen plz fix this bugs. Otherwise the game is so creative and building strategy game.,5
i think they have to do something with elecktro dragon. not just it can attack several defenses and building at the same time(chain attack) they also have lighting strike after get killed. its almost impossible to defense the village by air attacker mostly those with the electro dragon. night witch on builder base also need to be review. seems too op. maybe reduce the bat spawn can be helpful.,3
"The game is good new update is cool,strategy,clan but When i attacked there are always high level but low thropies when you attacked but when player attacked the always getting so many thropies. When i fight in versus battle i always fight some higher level and i always lose 4 or 5 times.",3
The game is fantastic but it can be even better if 2-3 upgrades can be done in the laboratory at same time as it takes a lot of time to upgrade a troop or reducing the upgrade time can also help to solve the problem.,4
I wish you could guide your troops more after deployment. The AI never goes where I want them to go and it really pisses me off when your troops go around the entire base instead of attacking through the center where you made a huge opening.,4
"This game is amazing, it not only allows you to get better with attacking your practices and can give you resources from it but it's not pay to win in a way. It was very friendly with others in the way it's kind of pay the witness cuz you can buy Jenkins they even give you deals which can give you gems a bunch of resources and something else in return. Which overall makes up for a really good game since you get things in return.",5
"I've played clash of clans for years, but something always felt off about it. Like to me it was always a 3-4/5. Never really a 5/5. And I realized semi recently why. Clash of CLANS. The game was mislabeled. Sure clan war was a thing, but the main focus of the game was on individual players fighting each other. Clans were always sort of on the wayside. But this new update finally fulfilled the true point of clans. Working together to take down other clans. Finally it's labeled right. 5/5.",5
Have been playing this game for some months but after recent update the game is not running properly in my smartphone and experience is very buggy and it's not like I have been using some very old smartphone I have been using Samsung galaxy S20Fe which released in 2020. So I would request developers to fix the problem.,2
"I would like to just say, the game is great. The only things I think should be changed is certain upgrade times and the way they match clans up against each other in clw and normal wars. Also, I'd like to mention, the game doesn't crash like a lot of people say. If you keep your phone updated, the game updated, use a reliable WiFi, you will not crash. I've tested the theory of it being WiFi and found that it is 9 times out if 10 because the WiFi is slow or bad.",5
"Patience is a virtue with this game: once you begin to build up your village the times for upgrades really add up. But it's a pretty fun way to pass the time, and learn along the way how to defend your village and tactics to win battles. You'll definitely be tempted to throw some money into getting another builder house, but for the most part the in-game ads for upgrades and gems aren't too annoying. Haven't experienced any technical problems or glitches which is nice!",4
"Never have I ever left a review. The game itself is so much fun. I have played this game for the last 8 years. Recently they implemented the most broken system. The clan report system is absolutely broken. Half of my clan got banned for ""Inappropriate behavior"" I chose to contact supercell and they either A provided you with no information and did not help at all. Just chose to defend there decisions and ignore my questions. The AI responses is terrible and this system is breaking the game.",1
"It was fun, until the last update came. After the update, every time I click on the events and news section, my game freezes and crashes after a few moments. For that reason, I reinstalled the game after uninstalling it. After opening the game, everything was normal until the 'Downloading Content' came. I thought it was normal and after a wait for few minutes I realized the 'Downloading Content' is infinite. It was sending me to the 'Supercell' screen back and forth. Please fix this.",1
"I highly recommend this game there are no adds, grate graphics loads to do all the time,it's a lot of fun though there are a few changes I would like to see 1. It would be nice if There was such thing as half stars because it is quite annoying when you get something like 99% on an attack and have to miss out on a whole star. 2. I think the training for troops and spells shouldn't take as long as it does, you should reduce it by *at least* 10%... there is more but I have run out of room sorry.",4
"Gameplay is easy, not too complicated. Second clash is fun and gives you something to do while you wait for things to upgrade. If you're not paying for gems, you may find your hands tied waiting. Not really an issue. Social can swing wildly from good to bad, but that's not the games fault. Training is super easy. Lots of troops to choose from. Overall enjoy playing, wouldn't mind more activities while waiting for troops and upgrades to finish.",3
"I'm a returning player, and I definitely remember why I left. Upgrading times are way to long. I think most of the times should be cut right in half. Like really 6 days for something is a crazy long time. Also most of your weapons take days to Upgrade at low levels. I can't imagine what they will be when I get them up higher, but it leaves you almost defenseless for days if you Upgrade multiple weapons at a time. Other then that there aren't too many problems, it's a decent game.",5
"A fantastic game. I been playing this game for years and I still love it. Good graphics, good gameplay, the game is simple and easy to learn for new players, etc... Only problem I have with this game is the was to add friends and talk with them. It is wary hard to add friends using a code. It could be batter if you can just search the name of the account to send friend request. And also, only was you can talk to someone is by joining there clan. Not a big deal but I rather have then changed.",5
"The best ever fantasy game in smart phone! Superb animation, gameplay and innovative events make this game more attractive. I took one star back only coz of the inconsistency in trophy earnings.",4
"First of all, nostalgic... been playing it since I was 8 although I had a few breaks and accounts... The gameplay although almost the same, is really exciting and interesting... The strategies are literally endless and it is nerve racking... never got bored of it",5
"Update bugs. The game won't open after most recent update. It says to update to the most recent version but the play store says I have the most recent version. I've cleared cookies, closed the app and restarted my device three times. It still won't load",1
"Dear sir, I don't know if anyone has said this before. I'm going to say it's a common problem for everyone. This is a game that many players with me are addicted to playing before the games that are available now. The problem is the time it takes to upgrade the level of the game. Some upgrades take about a month (this is not for heroes) so I even stopped playing the game for a long time. So I say if you can reduce the time for these upgrades, it's a great thingüòç",5
"Amazing experience, one of the games which have attracted me so much more than ever. Lovely controls, Never seen a glitch or bugs in the game. So smooth and guided.",5
"Great game doesn't give ads or pop ups, I have been playing a long time and it's still one of the best mobile games ever! I 100% reccomend, they update frequently adding more and more new things to the game. But a word of wisdom from a long time player is to not rush. Fully upgrade your defenses first",5
It's very fun although you do have to wait for the buildings it's a strategy game and it's really fun and is meant for patient people and you don't always want to rush once you get those 500 gems at the beginning you want to take it slow level everything up and then move on to a New Town Hall,5
"Genuinely one of the best games on the play store, and one of the greatest games in general. I love the whole fantasy medieval aesthetic of the game and all of the possibilities you can make with your village. Its also incredibly satisfying, like when you unlock a new troop or spell or hero you feel a great sense of achievement that feels great. Such a good game, would recommend to anyone. The only trouble I have is that the barbarian King isn't sexy enough.",5
"Amazing game . My entire childhood was basically this game . Everything is amazing though there is certain things that can be improved ,like time to upgrade it feels like a year to upgrade a cannon . Other than that, its truly one of the best games to be created .",5
"The Best in online strategy multi-player game. Thank you Supercell for this work. I have some suggestions: 1) Please bring an option to see if the attacker's shield is on or off in defense log. Also if that player is online or not. 2) Make the heros battle like any other troop in time of upgradation. 3) Please make an option to take Gold, Elixir and DElixir separately from Clan Castle. 4) Make the sceneries sell in the shop like skins for diamonds. PS: Fix the loading issue after each update.",5
It's a five star for me... This game is lit. I am a gamer so I know a good game once I play one. My brother introduced me to the game so I been playing for 5 days. It's been so exciting. The upgrades kinda difficult but it's all part of like. And I also love the clans and seeing them fight in friendly matches. I really can't wait to be bigger. Good luck clash of clans üëçüíñü•∞ü•∞,5
‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§ó‡•á‡§Æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ A very good game to get some time passed. Wars are always awesome in this. I hope Supercell will the reduce the upgrade time at 13 and 14 townhalls. Sometimes the sluggish nature makes me lose interest. Even the gold pass is of no use in accelerating the game,3
"Game is already amazing except for the builder base matchmaking. I cannot choose my opponent and my th 7 builder base is mostly matched with a th8 and sometimes its a fully developed th8. In multiplayer its okay because we have the right to choose an opponent but in builder base, IT'S SO FRUSTRATING! Edit: changing it to 1 because the builder base matchmaking really sucks. üôÉ",4
"there are some problems with the game which gets ignored by the developers everytime . The issue is...i am a town hall 7 player , I'm really good at this game and none th7 players attack me . The issue is with the trophy pushing , as a trophy pusher my current rank is silver-1 and when i search for players to attack , they show me players with loot of 7-8 trophies , and when someone attacks me , they take around 25-30 trophies from me . How is this thing acceptable!?",1
Was a great game when everything was fair. Especially when it comes to builder base battles. How is it that a person who put in all the time and effort to max out all the defenses and troops struggles to even get 50% of destruction against a way weaker base but yet a way lower army and troops can 100% a maxed out base with ease? Completely makes it not worth even trying to max anything out. And starting to find everyone gets a trophy but the people who do the work to try and earn it,2
"Great game, I downloaded a couple days ago and I am hooked. I have already grown my village so much and I can't put the game down. There seems to always be something to do, whether it's upgrading buildings, placing new ones, changing your defense, or attacking other villages. This game is so much fun and I highly recommend it.",5
The game play is really great i love it there are absolutely no flaws and sure the troop training may take a bit but when you battle it'll make your attack so much easier and you can travel from one village to another the heroes are good too so tnx supercell üòäüòäüòä,5
"Good game with good graphics but the more levels you cross, you will have longer waiting time for upgrading buildings and troops.. That should be lower in days.. After clearing some levels of game, it will become boring game..",4
"I was active in the Game, but didn't login with the Mail, logged in with the facebook. I accidentally uninstalled applications. Right now I couldn't access to my account. Please help me to recover my game. I have already spent so much amount to build up my village. I can share you the purchase details. I try to contact through mail but didn't get proper response. Please help me.....",5
"I've been playing Clash of Clans for about half a year. It takes some time to build up, but once you get high enough you can focus more on competition rather than creating the perfect base. It's a lot of different aspects so there's something for everyone.",5
"Best supercell game available, can easily upgrade without spending a penny though those who want to speed up with real money can easily. Consistent updates and all the great clan features mean that once you max out you'll still be able to enjoy the game.",5
gets boring pretty fast since you do the same thing all over and over again each time unlocking only different defenses and leveling up would rate it 5 stars it there was something else you could do besides the same thing example having to beat hard bosses using tactics or having a story line so there would be more going on,4
"This is a must annoying issue.. Our dark elixer storage are full but we dont have any where to spend it. Super troops are unlocked at TH 11. So what do we, the low TH levelers do? upgrading our heroes is also not enough to spend it. And training troops also isnt near enough to spend it. Its been months since my dark storage has been full. Please do some thing about it.. By the way I love this game very much...",5
"Love this game, play every day multiple times usually, but since your newest updates and patches last wk, it loads and then exits the whole game. I was unable to complete my league wars after day 3. Also I crafted the 2nd craft for the capital peak and it isn't even there, used gems to finish ish the craft, the gems got used but there is no second craft option to collect, it wants me to craft it again. I can't even try cuz it loads the game and then exits the whole game. Fix this, i wanna play!",5
"It is very fun to grind and at the beginning you can play it for an hour or 2 strait. After a while, the upgrades take multiple weeks. I highly recommend this game for anyone",5
"Love the game, but it just keeps crashing when I try to load into it, I have to clear cache and force stop 2 or more times each time I wanna play, so I have stoped loging in more frequently. Please fix this and I'll give it 5 stars.",1
"Best game from 2012 onward because it just has that timeless feeling, like you have all the tine in the world to work on your base i love that. But sonetimes the game would randomly freeze and then kick me out but that can be fixed really quick so for the time being 4 stars",4
"Five stars... Bravo, supercell!! This game is really addictive. Like, even when i played new games i can't get over with it. I just hope there was a new update where a new defense or building is available for starters...Edit: hello again SUPERCELL, just wanna tell you that the last update was a huge surprise for me, whose looking for new contents and challenges. Hope u keep it up, and also I'm considering rating you 7 stars for the said update( if I could)",5
"Super fun game, I've been playing since 2015 and I've never had a problem with this game but now it Kicks me out 3 to 4 times everytime I try to log on and the game is really laggy, which is really annoying and frustrating.",4
Best game ever. I've played it for 6 years and it is so fun. You get to upgrade things at your own pace and even if you can only play 30 mins a day you can still do everything you need to like upgrade. Love this game and will never stop playing it.,5
Great for mobile gamers who are looking for a challenge and to connect with friends online... Personally this is one of the best mobile online games ever in my opinion. You'll get hooked in minutes... Don't belive me go ahead and try it out for yourself,5
"Great game, I love everything about this game such as the heros the building the realistic timing of how long it takes buildins to upgrade and it's very strategic. There are so many strategys u can learn from a mobile game.üòÜ",5
Great update but there's a weird bug and I think u gotta fix it so when I get to the clan capital and then come back to the main village I'll have to press the return logo twice it doesn't work from the first so when I get back it tells me that I'm out of sync (please notice and fix ),4
"It's a very fun game, I have been playing it for years. It is somewhat slow to progress without paying for gems, but they have made it much better than in the past and the game is fun at any stage. (It's one of the only mobile games I actually bother to play so I raised my score from 4 stars to 5 stars)",5
It very easy to upgrade to town hall level 5 But then on wards it get harder When ever i open my clash of clan i always see my all defenses and gold etc taken away (broken ) Maybe there is a way like we can have more shield time ? Rather than that the game is so good i mean like awesome You guys should try it to .,4
"This game is so Good it doesn't even matter if you have a good or bad device, as long as it could run clash of clans it will be playable any time, it can be played for free, no need to spend anything if you don't want to, and the updates are getting better and better ‚ù£Ô∏è",5
"I've been playing this game for up to 8 years now. Its been my favourite mobile game since I played it. I have had multiple different accounts which I lost, but its so fun to restart and built back up. If you want a game you can have a bit of fun each day with an exciting grind. This game is for you.",5
"This game is pretty great. It does its job. It's very addictive and fun. The game play is never ending but it tends to get boring when you're waiting for things to upgrade. One of the things I do like about this game is that it does not force ads on you. Instead, you can gems to make the game play faster and overall more exciting. While fun, playing for long periods of time takes the fun out of it-play in small bursts. I recommend this game to people who don't have TOO much time on their hands.",4
Won't update and won't let me play. I am considering deleting it as it gets more problematic after every update. 02.05.2022 Yet again after the much vaunted upgrade 75% of my clan can't update. It says there is an update but when update button availed of playstore doesn't have it. We believe that they are the ones who availed of the update on 21.04.2022.. At this stage we believe that it is intentional as we avail of the game without spending much money.,1
I dont like the new update. I think that when you're opening the app itself it takes longer when logging in even though I have strong connection. I hope you make the loading faster like the old one.,1
"I actually like the game but, Atm im th8 and im pushing my trophies, but here's the problem, every time i tried to attack its always either +1,2,3,4 cup or Higher Th, like max th9 and th10, Finding something good always takes a lot of time, and when they attacked my base the trophies that they stole always 20/30/40 and 50 like wth? Ye, that's the problem, Hoping to change this method.",1
"Still a fun game, but bugs are making it less so. Their communication system is absolutely terrible. I'm still trying to play this with many images missing or just shadows.",1
"This is where the game sucks you in. You need resources to construct better buildings, and you need time to get better units into your army. Basically, everything requires time, resources (and money) to complete and upgrade. As one of the hallmarks of the mobile gaming genre, Clash of Clans has this aspect pretty much nailed. Of course, while the AI battles can be a great introduction to the basics of the game, PvP is where the real fun begins. Your castle is your base of operations and must be",2
"Ever since I started playing the game, I did really had a good experience from it, good gaming experience, lots of things to upgrade, and also became one of my biggest childhood game ever, but now it got better and better, but the builder hall is now quite hard to grind because of the match making, but overall the game is really good, I'd 100% recommend the game to anyone who likes this type of video games...",4
"I just downloaded the game and it doesn't let me go on it for some odd reason. I've tried uninstalling it and re-installing it but it wouldn't work. I have it on another device, i love the game but on the other hand the technical issue still bugs me quite a lot.",2
"I just superduper wish that the revenge button will be fix. I would really really suggest that they should show how many hours they have a shield ON in their village. It really makes me annoyed. Sorry for the words, I really like this game and this suggestion can really make the game more better. Thank you ^-^",3
"UPDATE MAY 2ND 2022 - now saying the game has an update but the playstore is saying otherwise, thus not letting me open the game, tried Uninstalling and reinstalling but continues saying the games needs an update... Would rate 5 stars but clash of clans says my play store needs updated (which it doesn't) and will not let me purchase the gold pass, although it hasn't been a problem before.",5
Overtime I see why there is no joy unless you pay. If your not paying to be the best your not. They disabled chat for many reasons.they have not many many changes and the changes they made for the time passed was effortless the night base has still no changes so dead. And does not matter where you rank in trophies there is always a counter to everything you decide to play on.,1
"super nice and addicted games i ever played. i salute to who is the Creator of this beautiful game. Good day&god bless to you and to your team. but can i request. Can you please. decrease the time once we build/built-in the DEFENSE, TH, or the other that we need to build it Once again super super addicted games I LOVE IT.",5
"My game crashes since the update has been released, my phone stop when I'm in loading screen ,it cause, Lot of issue after the loading screen stop , my phone cannot be touch or contacted with my finger , then the screen turn to black it will take time until my phone started to the lock screen and when I open the game ,it repeats the issue please fix this idk if my device is the problem or the update of the game thx,but I still love the game it just have some issue",2
"Crazy fun, very very grindy but thats what makes it fun. Qmazing design, great gameplay. Not super well optimized for lower end devices but it runs nicely. Better emulator support would be nice but it's understandable why it's not a focus.",5
With new update there is a bug often when I start the game there is no buildings visible and i can see only the ground and than if I wait for a moment black screen pops up... I love this game but currently it's ruining my experience,3
"I've been playing this game since 2 year and I'm having an amazing experience. The new raid medal rewards doesn't include builder potion, please add them also in daily deals it would be even much more satisfying for me",4
"I have given this game 1 star rating because I am facing a very serious and irritating problem in the game is the severe black screen problem. Whenever I am playing this game, I am getting a black screen problem every single time. I have even contacted supercell about this problem and the solutions they have given to me was not working at all. Other than that, the game is fun to play but the black screen problem is really disturbing the fun of this game.",1
"After the new update my mobile keep crashing, whenever I open the game it's lag a lot! And when I close the app my mobile just freez and after 2-3 min it's just crash! Just a waste update!!!!! I am uninstalling the game!",1
When you updated the newest update for may. It keeps telling me to update but when I go to update it it says play. And opens the game and repeats non stop. This update made my game unplayable. Until something gets fixed so it will load.,1
"Fun battle/puzzle game. The more you win the harder it gets, so loosing is useful. Often there is lots of waiting days for things to build if you want to keep it free",3
"I believe these folks deserve a fresh 1 star review. After all I've been through with this stupid game, now I can't even make in app purchases. Claims my password is incorrect even though I verified my Google password. I'm glad though. I needed a little help breaking my freemium app spending habits. Nothing helps me do that more than nonsense. Nothing confirms it more than nonexistent customer service.",1
Overall a good game. I only have one complain: can you put some rewards for the people who finished the pass early but they are still doing points? Something like the big box in brawl stars that you receive after level 70 of the pass. This would be great thank you.,4
Bloated and outdated. They keep adding features no one asked for and then don't update it. Builder hall hasn't been updated since 2019. Super troops haven't been updated in a year. Now they add Capital Hall? Update what we have first!,2
"great game, but the audio has is gone worse, like the sound effect is now gone and the audio is not mess it's just gone but after the clan capital update, and no one is making a video about this, is it bug or it could just be my phone, idk, i use a small phone btw :( but if it is a bug, then pls fix it anyways thx",3
"Okay! Now it happened to me. Like every other else said, ""Black Screen"". I waited for minutes, and eventually it loads. But before the loading completes the game kicked me out. Tried multiple times same thing happens.",1
"Its really good. The battles, troops, spells all are awesome. But i have one problem. I cant login to supercell. The verification code isnt mailed. Its the slight problem. Overall its perfect.",4
"I love this game, i playing this game after 5 years my account was Got it back. Please update rotate the base Bring.update time is too long,Please reduce the time of upgrades. Clan chat room chatting some messages can't show, It would be nice to come up with so many updates. Otherwise this game is really awesome üòé Very interesting game, time killer. Addictive game,",4
Clash of clans is a very good gaming app and I enjoy playing it but for updating resources or troops it takes more time and it takes more time to train troops and if we leave our game for a while or few days we lose many things in the game and we lose our trophies also,4
Firstly it is a good game. This has been the best strategy game for me for years. But when i got noticed about that you cant message globally it made me very angry. There are some other issues of this game which also made me angry they are 1. You Can't challenge after changing your base's layout. (Even the attacker can scout your village). 2. The upgrade time is so high that you have to play this game for years after years to fully max your village.,4
"Its been many years iam playing this game i start this game in 2016. But since the game has improved in many fields like graphics and many more but now I have one thing to say that this game is limited since its update have long many player left because of it, and this new update of clan capital its great. At the end but the game will only play by OG. This game is great but onesided and this disappointed thing of supercell, I think they have seek to this problem what people are also saying about",4
Amazing. Have been playing this game on and off since 2013 and can tell you its probably one of the best games on the playstore hands down. There are some things id like to see different though. When you get to a certain point the upgrades are just obnoxiously long. 14 Days is a really big amount of time and it feels unrewarding when you have to do multiple of them at once. All in all great game,5
Great game! My friends and I have been playing for longer than I can remember. The developers have done an amazing job over the years! This month a new update was released--adding a ton to the already addictive game--and created a new areana for us (clans) to wage war! 10/10. Highly suggest giving this game a try!,5
"Great game. You need both strategy and friends to win, not money necessarily (even so, esthetic stuff, like 'golem king', might be worth paying for it). They maintain and update regularly. It has a huge community. Part of esports etc. I just love this game.",5
"I have been a die hard player for several years, so it hurts to edit this review. I removed a few stars because of the absolutely horrendous support! I tried to activate Supercell ID, button not there. I talked to them, after 5 rounds of support, turns out my account is in China but is safe with Google Play, but I can't use ID. I tried again to see if we can fix that, but now they won't open any more support cases on the issue as it is ""resolved"". Disappointed in Supercell, I love this game.",5
I have 3 accounts in my devise. It has always been fun to play but after the recent update there is a minor bug but very irritating. Three of my accounts are on the same clan and every time i req form (accout1)and then login to (accout2) to donate then its not showing the requests .. so considering it a problem plz fix this soon.,3
"this is the worst and most annoying update of all, because I still have to wait for about half an hour before I can enter, and when im in the game ""connection lost and try again"" comes in, supercell, please fix this! Since you update the ""district"" I think, that's where it started!!! Please fix this sperceelllll!!! Ôøº",1
The game is amazing One of the great games I've played but since the new clan capital update came out the sounds from the gold storage no more makes that nice metal sound even when you tap the barracks it no more makes the training sound üò™ It is very sad to see that removed #bringthesoundeffectback,3
I love this game and I have been playing for four years. A very fantastic game. I would be happy more if you reduce the app's size and enable offline mode for some extent.,5
"Clash of Clans is very enjoyable! I don't know why people find clash of clans as a bad game. I believe that it can easily be free to play, just get good at the game and don't be trash. It is not violent in any way, all it has is the troops popping when defeated into elixir bubbles and a tombstone appearing, how could it be violent",5
"Great game and everything was good until the recent update. My game works fine but the clan capital does not. Clickinh on anything inside the clan capital gets me stuck on the loading screen and then I have to restart the game. I've reinstalled it twice, I can't play clan capital,just can collect medals that's all",3
"It's fun off and on, but honestly lacking anything to do on a daily basis. All builders working, full storages, and waiting. There are clan wars, but there's nothing for solo or small group play. They need some type of vs mode like they have in the builder base, small group vs a larger than normal base, etc. Anything really haha. Also, more space and walls for creative base design ... they all tend to look the same.",2
"I would give this a five stars if you fix: 1. adding a sheild to turn off and on so when you don't want your base being attacked you can turn it on, 2. Make the upgrades take an hour not 11h, 3. make the troops protect your base, 4. Making everything less expensive and 5. give us a way to earn cash and expire faster, 6. remove the stuff you need to build in order to upgrade your town hall it takes up most of your space and it takes up most of your money you need to upgrade your town hall/Castle.",4
"It's quite enjoyable, though the builder base upgrades take way too long and its loot is relatively small. Also, walls and air defenses take too long to upgrade.",4
"After May 2022 update . The graphics in my redmi note 7 pro mobile reduced drastically. When I zoomed in all bulidings are blury rather than Heroes. They are still in good condition, I mean in graphics. Resolve this issue as fast a possible.",1
I really like this game and I think it's alot of fun. There's only 2 thing's about it I don't care for much. It suck's you have to wait alot when you build and upgrade thing's. Also getting the gem's is harder than it should be. Other than that the game is awesome and ton's of fun.,4
Strategy; Patience ;Skills r the bacis of the game .Though I started it playing in 2016 but it is still interesting and nice üëç but I think the amount of time required is something that make people without having patience and time away from it ...rest aspects are good üî•no problemüëå,5
"Great game but gets boring after a while, I got my family into it then we all abruptly stopped playing. Then after one or two years I rediscovered it and got hooked again. Graphic are pretty good you can customize your bases too. But the reason I gave COC 4 stars is because of the gems, they are so rare and it's very difficult to keep them. Rarely you get a gem box but that only gives you 25 or 30. But anyway overall it's a great game.",4
"The game still holds up but when u get to the final stages it becomes a slog. Started years ago, had a break for a few years, came back had a bit of fun but i'm starting to get tired of it now. Plus, I was trying to gain back my old 2nd Vill back thru the support, had all the evidence they asked for but they banned my main account for a month anyways for ""account phising"" even tho I had proof??? Overall, okay game for a bit, horrible customer support, if u want an old account back don't bother.",3
Very fun game. I am really enjoying it. The graphics are exceptional and the gameplay is just amazing. The competition as you get to higher levels gets even harder which I really enjoy. And I also love the features of this game!! I do have to say that when you get to higher townhalls you ar e going to wait for some time which is something I like because it's worth the wait.,5
"Very fun, you have to commit to the game as it takes time to achieve a high level. Its a very creative game and you can level up the base in many different ways and orders.",5
"I've been playing this game since a long time. Three or four times I had to change account. But still I love to play this game and the most annoying thing about this game is that it takes toooooooooooo much time to upgrade any of it's troops, buildings, defense etc. If the upgrading time will be reduce to some extend than it would be very kind of you all. I know nothing comes for free in today's world but still there are lot of people like us who are not so rich enough to buy all those stuffs.",4
"Game is overall fun. The new update is also well but need some improvements,like relaxation of amount of resources to convert to capital gold. More attacks in raid weekends. More methods to gain capital gold. In home Village like reduction in upgrade time. Recruitment system should be improved.Air attacks should be nerfed so there is a balance.Also builder base should be addressed (Personally my favorite mode).It should be linked to home Village other than Otto I think that it should reworked.",4
"The game is very casual; because it limits the speed at which you progress in the game, it's not too addicting. I very much like it and I doubt the updates and events will get boring anytime soon.",5
"Game is not running properly in Redmi7A. When I open it the Game shows black screen and it turn off, sometime all buildings disappear or only green tiles is shown . Supercell it's my humble request to please address this problem to respective departments and solve this problem.",1
I enjoyed the Clash of Clans interface. I liked the games graphics and the playing field as well. The games easy to play and it entertaining to keep in the menu as a last resort game. Keep making games.,5
The game was fun when there was global chat. now you have to go into a clan and see if its active and if it's not then you leave and find a new one. Atleast add someway to interact with poeple from different clans. Also the game keeps flooding me with notifications saying my upgrades are done but when I click them my upgrades aren't even close to being done. It's either a bug or a way to get me to play the game more but it's annoying and frustrating so fix/remove these and I'll give 5 stars,3
The game is great I used to play it way back 2016. I played again last year and gained some gems to buy a Hero Skin then I decided to quit for a moment like 7 months. I downloaded CoC again last week and my only skin is gone like is it a trial skin or something. I hope someone help me get it back cause my account is like 6 y/o and as a free to play player it's hard to gain gems.,3
I've been playing this game for about 8 years and have really enjoyed it. It's a great free game with some perks if you spend money but not required. I've enjoyed all the updates they've put into it recently and over the years. Thanks for making an awesome game!,5
"Best mind games I ever play so interesting. But after the new update there are some connection issue like network problem in the middle of match etc. But the game is fantastic. I play this fromm 2 years. But one thing I have to tell that when I connect my first account of to super cell I'd I think that my account is safe and for some I have to delete my clash of clans and when after 2 week I again install it then I see that I have not my on of the account,and for this I have to make a anotherid",4
Good game but improve the rate of giving trophies I am pushing master at th 9 but it is hard it take almost 20 to 30 minutes to get a good base I suggest to give trophies according to town hall not league and I get at least 30 to 40 trophy minus loose and the attacker is of town hall 10 please fix this problem thank you,5
I am banned by supercell due to the attempt to recover my account. My old device was broken so I have to transfer my account to my new phone but they banned me for recovering my account given that I can't use my emails due to recovery issues as well. I bought gems as well on my previous account. I hope this message is an opportunity to improve the game. Thanks,1
"Just got off probation on May 1st, 2022 for phishing my old account. I was trying to retrieve my old account and restore my original game! I've sent several messages and still nothing. Update! Just got banned for 31 days for trying to regain my old account (phishing). I applaud the security but I really wish this was handled better.",1
The game is good . Though when you are in a High th the upgrade time is too long. But its acceptable .. you can communicate with your teamates which is good. And you can ask help to win a war or to secure stars in multiplayer attack .,5
Game is crashing. I try to open it and the loading page says An Update is available and where ever I click it takes me to play store but there is no update on the store just either Uninstall or play when I play it again takes me back by saying update is available.!!!,1
"The matching is unfair specially in versus battle mode, they will match you to a higher builder level and probably 80% of the match result will be in favor of the higher level because they have more buildings than the lower builder base. Please consider this one. Maybe because its one of the reason why the builder mode is quite boring to some. Hope you will have a better plan for these kind of problem.",4
"This games fun, enjoyable would recommend, just some glitches with the, ""disconnection,"" apparently I lost a battle with 69% because I disconnected for a second. I gained nothing from it and some of my troops were actually used, hopefully just me",4
"Game was perfect before the update, after the recent updates game automatically crashes and lags alot, and now it doesn't open in my phone. I'm not able to open the game right now.",2
"It's a nice game but there's a bug in loading screen saying ""downloading content"" it keep days and i can't even play the game because of the bug, so please fix this problem. Thank you.",2
I've played the game for 3 years and the problem is the upgrades take WAY TOO LONG like some can go up to 2 weeks and more! You need to fix this. I don't play for a long time because of the upgrades.,3
"Hi, all good pretty satisfied with the game I love everything thats in the game. But there is a minor issue like ; *We get 2 lifes for heroes *We have 2 armies trained BUT WE CAN ONLY REQUEST CC TROOPS ONCE. it would be great if we could request CC troops after 3 minutes of our previous request. 3rd CC request will be okay in normal time. That wil help us getting 2 of our attacks done without using gems for it.",4
"Never see my reviews. But a hard game if you play it straight. Relaxes and invigorates. Easily move up if joining a clan or buying relevance is your thing. There are options. I do it the hard way. Time , work ,practice and solitary. Gotta tell ya. I have seen both groups of people in my time. FUN either way. But I prefer my way.. Clan ya later.",5
it's a good game but the matchmaking in the builder/versus mode kinda sucks because it mostly matches you to player with higher townhall level and hopes that you'll win and the army camp messes up my strategy because everytime i donate troops it is automatically filled up by troops that is already cooked I wish they add a function where you can manually pick the troops before filling up the army camp so please fix that,3
"It was super engaging game initially for first 5 or 6 years but slowly game is losing it's fun elements. Players are maxed since months but no new content plus same old upgrades for heros wall defenses are not exciting. Many players in friends list are not active and not in any clan either. I too have lost interest in game. Good luck Supercell, hope you guys turn around this game. Bye",3
"This game is amazing. But there is one thing i not like is that in the battle if we won we get around 16 or 17 trophies and if we loose we lost 25 to 26 trophies. I think you understand this. So, please solve this problem in next update.",4
"Extraordinarily enjoying, time killer, build, upgrade, arrange, attack, defend in the way you like. But in every way, you will learn the mastercrafts free. Players can pay to become stronger much faster",5
The game is awesome and i think there should be some automatic updater where we put things in line for upgradation. So that an upgrade starts itself after completion of upgrade of a building,5
Worst of all. This game just sucks. FOOKIN SUPERCELL don't have an algorithm to match the players of equal town hall of builder base. If u r growing in the game like you have too many trophies then they start matching you with the players who are much ahead of you. Worst experience.,1
"I at first played this game for like 1 year , then i stopped playing this game .After like 3.5 years when I came back, it is like super fun! But one day they locked my account and when I tried to contact help and support it says to find the gmail account and login with that. But how jow it is locked and need a unlock code. This was my main account, and this made me really sad which led me to quit the game. My heart is really broken now.But i love this game thats why I gave it 5star.",5
"It's one of the best game with complex planning . It's a challenging with good idea's we need skill to play the game . Frankly speaking , I play it for hours spend my free time with this. I think it is the best game I have played",5
A wonderful game. But if you start a battle and haven't deployed all your troops then if the connection lost you will lose the battle. Reloading of battles are not working properly.,4
"I really appreciate this game, it's exciting when you play this..so you can use the hero base on your level of your town hall ,and when you upgrade it's every building you can find more troops and upgrade them to become a higher level of it's..injoy and fun",5
The game was excellent and I have made a huge progress in few days and after the update my game was not responding .after clicking the icon the screen will be black and the game crashes please fix it I don't want to lose my account,4
"The game is great.. regular updates and fun events.. my only problem is the builder base.. i know it takes time but i suggest the upgrade bonus for townhall would be different for the builder base.. like x4 loot for 4 days and troop and hero boost and collectors boost.. i mean like as soon as you upgrade your builder hall, youd get a boost similar to townhall and ihope events woth x4 loot in the builder for qol... pretty great game so far!",4
The new clan capital update is a very interesting update .. but at the same time after the update alot of bug is happening like I keep stuck at the loading screen when i tries to log in . Sometimes cannot log in . I hope this will be fixed soon . Then I will give my last star,4
Good game but the only one problem is the sound glitch in every building and troops when i tap a building the sound is just like wall and when a cc troops lure out a sound like upgraded building+lower quality in home village and builder baseüò¢ please fix it supercell. I give 4 star for this,4
"The game strategy is superb. If you are bored i recommend this game, a good time killer. Play this game in good endurance, If you entering to the next next level the time period of upgradation will increase and that is the brilliant idea of this game too.. otherwise its bad. I really love and enjoying this game.",4
Various different objectives in two separate bases keeps the action rolling most of the time. Usually something to progress and new challenges to complete that keep you interested.,4
I've been playing since 2015 and still enjoy the game a lot. It's so satisfying to watch your little th2 base go so far. Has a great and unique combat and defence system. Definitely recommend the game to anyone! Update: The game is still great but it takes forever to find a base your level the people it matches you with are always over leveled at that the lvl or a th or 2 above.,4
after today's update... I m not able to login.. and even if game logins after taking too long..it will buffer and show connection issue and then it will say to login again... every time it freezes and same connection issue is showing...but my internet is working just fine in any other apps and even downloading something is fast... pls fix this ASAP.... or I will miss my cwl,2
"If you have a good/reliable internet connection the game works perfectly. One of few games that exist for almost 10 years for mobile phones and are still very popular and get regularly updated with new content. I love the game because it takes time, skill and a bit of luck to get progressive in game. I love easy account switching with ""Supercell ID"" if you have more then 1 account. The game is optimised really well and it doesn't consume that much power so you can play it on older phones too.",5
"It is a good game.. I'm a returning player and I have the reason why I quit playing the game, it's because the upgrades take to long like 8 days ? LoL and the clan gap... Everytime we join to clan war league our enemy is always to strong to handle..like th 6 vs th 10 lol.. many players quit and tired playing this game because of this problems..and I'm one of them and also my friends ...",3
"Forced update button sends me to app store with no option to update. Only shows ""uninstall"" and ""play"" buttons. I uninstalled and re-installed, then sent back into the loop again. Please help.",1
"The game itself is amazing. No pay to win, just grind and base design. Love the variety of troops and buildings but would be nice to have more updates.",4
"Please reduce training time for all troops (Long time for training troops is making this game boring) as well as reduce building and king, queen and other special characters upgrading time and provide daily login rewards like other games providing.. so you might get 5 stars.",3
"I LOVE this game. But there's a point. I wish we could change the name of our clan or name of our own account easier. Please think about leaders a little bit. I would really like to have something, such as a bot, which automatically chooses the best members of the clan for wars. I wish there was a better environment in clan chats (the possibility to reply on classmates' messages and more stickers). Hope you guys read my feedback. Thanks a ton.üôÇ‚ù§",5
Clash of Clans was the first online for almost everyone im playing the game from 2013 though i take some breaks in between but these new updates and all are ruining the game it was so good when it was normal..things started changing after the night village update and from then on it is defaming day by day . Although im sad but i will keep playing it for the rest of my life ü•∫üôè,3
"This game is the best tactical game out there, the only problem is with the new update.. you literally can do nothing with the clan capital base except contritbuting and thats it, which is super boring if you think about it. So please coc team, we have to get some role or something fun to do and not only leaders have full acess to the base!",3
"This is a great game! I enjoy playing this game everyday and overall is very addictive. The only thing I have to say is when I get attacked, the attackers are usually much further into the game (E.g Have higher upgrade levels in Barracks). I'm currently on Town Hall 11, working to get to 12.",5
"App keeps crashing after the update. Currently in th14, bye bye now. Worst app... Releasing updates without even proper testing. Reported multiple times but no response. Worst crashing app. No use even after deleting the storage and reinstalling multiple times. Worst experience.",1
"I absolutely love this game. But this new update made the quality totally messed up. The little fine details Ibusually love aren't as sharp and crisp anymore. I know it's probably because all the extra added content. But like I said, the quality is what took a beating. Anyway, thank you for an amazing fun game!",5
Absolutely love this game... Been playing the game for more than 5 years although i did leave the game for many months in between but everytime i get back to play there's always something new and interesting.. honestly i can't tell how much i love this game üôèüèª really simple fun to play..alot of memories.. and best of all you won't rage quit ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥,5
"A great game with complex strategies & Planing. It's a great strategic game, very addictive and it has continues updates to keep the game always interesting. There is always something new to do in the game. Try it out, It's fun. The only con of the game is the real time upgrades, to max out everything, from the start to the end of the game it takes almost 6 years.",5
"Omg! I have been play this game since a year after its release, this game has been always been my favourite game and will always have a special place in my heart. Although as disappointed as I was when global was removed all the great updates has compensated for that. I truly enjoy this game and would suggest everyone to give it a try.",5
"Literally amazing game I've ever played. It is best for every one for t teen child too cuz it's a strategic game. I'm playing this game since 2 years and not get board yet.hello plz fix my issue my game is not updating,when it get 100 download is showing some error pls fix it.",5
"App has been crashing too frequently after the latest update. Moreover, the app crashes in the middle of the attack and eventually looses the battle.",2
"One thing that bothers me is when i'm attacking there's a notification that will pop up where it says ""Client server error"" that restarts my game everytime. Overall it's a perfect game, you don't need a single cent to play this game. Although you can buy resources and magic items to speed up your progress, it doesn't matter for F2P players because they only need to do is join cwl and earn medals so they can buy magic items for themselves without spending money.",4
"the game is good, been playing a long while and the only issue I have is that in the recent update I lost 500 gems from nothing. I logged on my account and saw 500 gems missing from my 7485. I checked the new weekly shop, no items was purchased, none of my building timers were changed either... heck. it just disappeared and I never used it nor anyone else has access to my account and spent it without knowing. there should be a way to show what were my recent gem purchases ingame",3
"I got info that my Supercell login expired and I tried to re-login and of course the code I entered was correct. But after that comes the info ""Incorrect verification code"" appears. I think it's Supercell's fault, not me.",4
"So this game was honestly one of the best games aot there, but the developers made lots of updates and additions, to the point that my 60frame phone can't even handle updating it, it has been like a few hours now and i still can't seem to play it and my internet is running on 1.4gigabytes per second, that's INSANELY powerful internet connection, And i just liked the good old clash of clans. Other than that good game, now i'd give this game 4.5 stars but i can't so 4 stars",4
"Cool game. However, upgrade times are ridiculous. Ive met lots of people who stopped playing and uninstalled the game for this reason. And i cant begin to explain how discouraged i am from playing. Cut upgrade times in half.",3
"Excellent game can't say much more only just getting into it after 8 hours the builders pack for a fiver makes the game a whole lot easier not saying it's pay to win but it's a free game ........ Can't go into much more but I'm hoook right off the back highly recommended for people with time to ""waste"" wanna waste less time join a clan ...... Anyways signing of MrDeeBait",5
"Love the game. Hate that there a still a lot of glitches that I wish they would fix. Lose connection quite often, even when you have full bar on a WiFi network.",3
"This game is awesome and with so many new features I can't wait to start raid weekends soon! The only thing this game needs is a way to share base resources between clan mates, such as gold elixir and even dark elixir, and I think we should be able to boost more things with gems in the home base, like the builder huts and the laboratory. Other than those minute things this game just keeps getting better!",5
"Supercell, your help and support is not useful at all. It's not responsive, I had bought this season's gold pass and still after 24 hours of the purchase I haven't received my purchase also my money got debited in a second. Where should I go to contact you? How things can be put right? I need may gold pass and your improved help and support for the players.",5
"Game is nice, but this game in certain time, will going to downloading content too long and maybe not function anymore, its too long downloading content and at the last its going error server, so a solutions that i do to play this game again is uninstall and install again, i hope your organizer will see for this problems, THANK YOU!",2
"I had this game about 5 years ago, and I soon lost track of time to play it. About 3 months ago, I picked up my chromebook and scrolled through my apps. I remebered all the good times I had playing, and now I play 1-2 times a week. Still really addicting!",5
Very fun I love the game. One issue is that some achievements are hard and will take a lot of game time (unless you are pay to win) but the game is overall a good game.,5
"I like it's art design and unique enimies, however it is a pain to get the troops to where you wan't to go, place them just barely an inch from the target and they'll walk away and attack something elsec There's Manipulative Marketing targeted towards children, they're aware of it. Not for kids who have irresponsible parents. They don't collect data until 13 (I think) but will still try to sell in game cosmetics, loot, etc. by use of such Marketing They've been able to make over a $100,000 Daily",2
It is a very thriling game its also fun to play special thanks to supercell but there is some gitches such as The games crashes on time The game is fun but required high town level to build fences plzz low down the price to get more reviews And also down the level that is required to build more defences plzz do it,5
"I rarely give 5 star reviews for mobile games. But this one is an exception. It's a pretty fun idle game for when it's slow at work. And the microtransaction system is not super predatory like most mobile games. The paid currency ""gems"" can actually be earned from completing achievements and challenges. It's a grind, but they can be earned through play if you have the patience. I haven't felt the need to buy gems, I don't mind earning them.",5
"I really enjoy the game overall. The graphics, the characters, and gameplay are great. However, it takes too long to complete buildings and to level up.",4
"Everything about this game is perfect. There's great pvp action and building as well as lots of other things. However, what could be changed (my opinion) is the timer on upgrades for certain buildings. Even some early game upgrades can take up to a day to finish. Not even including some other buildings or upgrades that can take a whole week to be done. Ending of at that note, 4.5/5 for this amazing game",5
"This new update with the Clan Capital is really cool, but I have one problem with the update. Why did ya'll change the look of the tall grass in Builder Base? My account name is, bananas(if you wanna check), I had a nice Garden around my monuments on my Builder Base. Now the grass looks tiny, and it doesn't look as cool anymore.",5
"This game is amazing! First it's like a never ending game , Secondly there's two modes one Morning and second Night time , Then there's different kind of troops and online people we can attack! And lastly there's different building for different purposes!üëçüèÜüíØ",5
"Well this game is so good but if there is one problem that is building or upgrading take more much time and its the fantacy of this game .very much strategic and mind using game that how to defend our village and by what mean i means to say that how to fully destroy other villages by using different kinds of armies as air or ground but the only thing is that,that it only works on your Powerful strategy üòä..",5
Don't get if you don't like getting put up against bases 3 or more levels above you when your trying to join your friends in a clan but can't get the right amount of trophies cause you keep lossing against higher level people I should now add every time im trying to play strategically on builder base I get multiple heavylag spikes when I'm attacking this is the same as clash Royale lots of heavy lag spikes which need to be fixed,2
This game is amazing it helps me to calculate the amount of resource to build and other activities. But there is also wrost part of this game it takes lot of time to cook army and build the structure supercell might make even better this game in future update,5
"This game is really amazing! I'm now a th11 and love the hero skins. I have no problems with this game at all. The only games I always have on phones are Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. The gold pass is an amazing addition into the game! (But don't have enough money to buy them all) The clan capital update really brings clash of clans together as the name says, it a clash of clans. This game never gets boring or old.",5
We need more good scenery. Classic one is boring.. (create some free basic scenery && some paid epic scenery && also some [expansive gems] scenery. Please make sure that it doesn't need any higher townhall).. bring something new and different.. also the latest update had something new but it is not different.. i think it may be the flop idea. Let see!!,3
"I get to experience a lot of game crash why is that? Specially when I'm about to attack the game automatically disconnect. Then whenever I came back, boom! Minus trophy",3
Why does this game loading screen sucks always downloading content everyday and then suddenly lost connection to the server ALWAYS im doing this for nearly 5-7 hours just to be able to log in again even though my internet is good give me an explanation to this or solve this problem then ill change it back to 5 stars cause i really love this game yet this always happens,1
"Even after cost reduction game is still fallen back, Many things makes it booring but we can't quite because of its intresting game pattern. Game should have more time reduction then that of cost because my resources are filled full but builders are not free!!",3
"The upgrade times need to be decreased but theres still stuff to do while you wait, and sometimes its nice to just be able to get off for a week and take a break. Other then that, its not pay to win, but its pay to progress faster. you always fight people your own level except maybe in cwl so theres not problem with you having to pay money to be at the same level as people.",4
The game is fun but one downside of it when you rich high town hall thinks go way too expensive so if they reduce the cost a little bit. That will make it more fun than waiting for your upgrade and loot. üòÅ,4
Fun... without all the fear of losing all your troops and hard work. Also nice that it is not necessary to kick off your own repairs after an attack. Enjoying the game.,4
"I absolutely love this game until recently when it stopped loading. I tried everything, I've uninstalled restarted reinstalled still no luck. I've spent more money than I want to admit on this game and now it won't even load. Very very upsetting.",1
"i need help to recover my game. i tried everything from 'help and support', none of them are working. well, it's more like they don't have same problem that i have. i really need human's help. my google account still have my game progress, the system says that i have to log in with supercell id. the problem is i accidentally replaced it with new one. so everytime i connect with supercell id, it load the new one. my game on google account is still fine tho.",1
"This version is crashing down, everytime i log in there's a black screen. I have to restart again and again to get access into the game. Loosing interest in it now",2
I've been playing this game since 2013 to 2017 Nd now I reinstalled it recently. I really loved it before and still now. But I really miss global chat. I know it was toxic Nd stuff. But that was a major part which made me like this game more. The strangers turning into friends all around the globe. That's one of a kind experience. Bring back global chat. With regulations maybe,4
"I really love the new Clan Capital update. I only have a problem with one thing: the fact that we need to use builders to craft Capital Gold in the Forge. While I do understand that it is realistic that they are required, I think this shouldn't be the case because, except for fully maxed out Town Hall 14 players, it slows down the progression in the Home Village for any player who wants to contribute to the Clan Capital. Please consider letting us craft Capital Gold without using a builder. ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",3
This game is stupid cuz the game keep restarting and saying no connection even i have very good wifi connection it just so hard to finnish an attack when it just restart and go back to the start.More harder thing is the you used up your attack at clan wars or clan leages plssss fix it like just hang there until the connection to the server is back,2
"I give 5 stars cuz why not :) The gameplay is cool but its kinda sad this game is ""dead"" to my friends...but still i enjoy it and i also like the creative animation that you guys create on youtube...ive been playing this game since 2017...maybe 2016...i dont remember...but still thanks for keep updating and the last thing i want to say...can you make clash-a-rama season 3?",5
"Supercell , please fix the bugs. When the game is start , then mobile screen automatically going black and game is crashed... There is very problem to continue this game .. Please do something quickly..",2
Hope we can share our resources to our teammates. But is fun playing it. You will be able to find new friends and strategy with your teammates. Hope we can cancel the choosen super troops like if u have super goblins and super dragons and can cancel one of them.,4
Great game. Would give 5 stars if they fix it. Crashes all the time since recent update. Unplayable. I have Android device. Worked great for years until this patch.,1
"It's good, but I'm now done with it. It's been a long journey and now this game has been thrashed. Updates and to generic to other games, and boring. It's been a good ten years but it's time to put away the potions, hang up the swords and retire the dragons.",3
Connection lost issue.. It is a great game i loved it but right now i am facing connection lost issue and it is very frustrating... In the middle or beginning of the attack i receive the connection lost note... And i lost everything... Please fix it,4
Game keeps crashing and not loading properly. It gets annoying cause I am trying to get on the game and do my war attacks. There are times when I can't get on and miss my attacks. If you could fix this it would be great. Got a new phone and it seems to be a lot better so far no crash and game loading a bit faster and I am glad,4
Playing this game for last few years. Still loving it. I used to play this after a while because of the long period of upgrading. I actually think that the clan games rewards must be more because I can finish my wall upgrading very fast. My favorite troop is pekka because it has a strong shield and life time and it is much more powerfull than any other troop in the game. But I just get tired playing in the builder base. I dont know why but still I feel that very much boring. I will recommend th,5
"Look... It's a good game. But they ban you for some stupid reason for ""phishing accounts"" I got a new phone and couldn't figure out the password for my old account. I used another one of my accounts to contact them and Because I couldn't get a hold of my old email they ban me. This is on another level of stupid. I tried another time and got banned, AGAIN. Their customer service is pretty bad. I did after a while get my account back, with someone who was actually helpful.",3
"Great game, been playing for years. But recently it keeps kicking me off the game randomly, even midgame, just freezes and closes down, so annoying. Please fix thisüíØ",3
"This game is like no other, it develops strategy and cool bases. I think this game is fantastic, sure the upgrades take long but it allows you to be on the game only once in awhile instead of always being on",5
Very nice game but when there is a bit of network problem only during multiplayer battles the games suddenly crashes and we lose trophies ...plz solve this ... perhaps make a provision to play multiplayer battles offline....,3
"Game lagges in between. The full screen turn black, I am facing this issue after the new update, otherwise the game is good. Please fix this bug as soon as possible. Thank you coc",2
"Great game mind and strategy game. I didn't find any disadvantage, some say upgrading time is disadvantage but i didnt find disadvantage in time it's keep game longer to play. I love this game. Playing since 2016",5
"Game states that there is an update but when I press to update it takes me to the play store. The choice is either uninstall or play. Can't play the game cos I can't install the update and can't update to play the game. What the hell is going on here? Please sort asap. Support have just asked me to make contact through the game so they can see my ID and sort the issue. CAN'T GET INTO THE GAME COS IT ASKS ME TO UPDATE. Every time I contact them, the same generic email comes back, cus service?",1
"I started Clash of Clans 8years ago and 3-4years back I gave my account to my friend and I took it back from him after a year. My friend added his id as supercell id and when i took it back from him, I was trying to change that id and my account got locked. By chatting alot with customer service they were asking details like provide model of all the phones in which you played it.I had given 90%info correct but they are not giving it back.How can anyone remember all phones of such an old account.",1
"Its a fun game but don't bother wasting real money on this game. As soon as you upgrade your stuff, the game automatically matches you against harder players so you never get ahead of the curve and you never really get better. Stupid",1
It was quite good but still need some updates like the war timings would be less and the update timings should be reduce because it take about half a month which is more more so we need an upgrade that fixed with the problem of donation also the number of troops should be increased thank you I believe it is the bestest game in my life.,5
"At first i thought the graphics is not good but im wrong, I like the graphics this latest coc is nice same as throne rush it will more beautiful if the graphics will be more realistic the troops,building,defends and resources honestly i don't like the old one coc so i dont play this game but i like throne rush but now the graphics change i like it..üòäüòÅüëç",4
"this is a best game i have ever played, loves to play but after the latest update this game has become glitchy.Everytime when I wish to change supercell ID or going to night base or clan capital the game glithes and everything disappears a sudden and after that the game stops and after a moment I am seeing my home screen.üòëüòîüòî‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è",2
"I just entered the game then it crashes and freezes then goes back to my wallpaper screen i do not know if it is the game or the device if it is the game please fix this but apart from this the game is very good too,(this is an edit ), you solved my problem through the recent updates thanks",5
"It's been great, honestly wish I could have gotten it earlier, the only downside I've experienced personally is the chat being a little goofy, but does that really matter? (No!) If you're looking for an instant win, instantly on the top, find another game, but it's great for what it is, as an idle game it's the golden standard.",5
"The game was addictive. Straight to the point, High refresh rate was not properly working on all devices. Try to add haptic feedback. And it draining battery much compared to other Supercell games(especially Brawl stars). And Need time reduction for th12. Thank you",4
This is an amazing game especially for its price tag which is none. I find myself playing this game to three times a day I bring my tower is battling it's quite fun it's not a game fight spend your whole day playing but it's getting but you'd upgraded over the years and then look back at what you used to be and then oh wow Im like so much better nowüòÅ,5
Amazing online game..... Great graphics and wonderful gameplay and global interaction with players world wide... üëçüëçüòá I've given 4 but not 5 stars because the in game events are boring and rewards are a kind of waste.. SOMETIMES rewards are only 10 gems or even less this is bad... üôè,4
Got to install this again to see improvements. So there. You cannot watch a replay without touching the screen. Lol 3 sec and the app will close.,1
"Great game overall, adding raids to your own base, sort of like a survival mode with rewards and waves. You test your own base defenses. Difficulty will be based off of your town hall. That'd be a great idea. A game similar to this called ""Star Wars Commander"" (may that game rest in peace, we loved you) had a similar mechanic.",4
"No one really likes the constant bot Loses (builder village). They keep you losing by small margins to keep you playing longer each day (to get daily loot). ..also , your men will avoid the most important thing to atk. Very blatantly sometimes. Even though it's the townhall üßê Makes it a waste of time. Disenfranchis the game.",1
"I really like this game because you can create your own village! You can also attack other villages, get rewards, do tasks, challenges, and much more!! The clan I joined was very friendly clan and they helped me with my village!! I recommend this game to other people because it is soooo FUNNN!!",5
Its very awesome game to me it is very interesting but there is a difficulty because as u upgrade your townhall the buidings defenses take more time to upgrade as infermo and x bow it takes of time to upgrade troops in research lab but it is good . I will place this game in second number because first game pubg. So i give 3 stars to this game,3
"I was going to give an amazing review up until the point where my new account was banned for reason ""phishing"" while I was trying to recover my old account even though I answered all the relevant questions! Very upset thay over 8 years of game play is in the bin! Customer support is taking for ever to respond too! Amazing game but absolutely terrible experience right now",1
"I just updated d game. After apdating, i can no longer play d game. Bcause, request update of d game always appear. So i uninstalled it and re-install again, but the same problem appear. So i cannot play the game again because of it I can only give 2 stars for now, unless the problem fix.",2
"Hi , I'm Playing Clash Of Clans From Past 5 Years , From Two days Onwards the game is loading and loading and it's going back it came so many times , so I Deleted the game . Again I Installed The Game To Restore My Account So I Can play happily , but now also It's loading and loading and going back . Please üôè Supercell please check my issue , this is the first time I'm facing this problem. I'm Hoping You'll Help me out with this problem.",1
"From 5 stars to 1 if i can do 0 i would, theres an annoying bug in this game. I hate it, because when i change my village load out it says "" village changing failed, try again"" like that this stupid bug waste my time and i know the devs aren't gonna read this because thought They're game is perfect. now if the devs see this then its a win win.",1
"There we go clan capital !! Even aftr so many years of this game which other games dont even see, we are getting game changing updates for the legendary gane. I have been a clasher since 2015 and I am still playing this complex strategy based game. Well,i stopped many times in between but I always find my way back here !!!",5
"Great game!! I've been playing this game since I was still 11 yrs old, until now, it needs a LOT of patience and hardwork to become strong, once said ""If you need power to become strong, you need a lots and lots of patience to become both powerful and strong..."" but still, I appreciate the game, THANKS A LOT SUPERCELLüòÑüòÑ",5
Good game. They've improved a lot over the years. They've listened to the community. Well done. Frequent suggestions for microtransactions are mildly annoying. Clan games and seasons provide good incentive and rewards. Well done on making a good game even better. Best wishes,4
"Ahh yes, Clash of clans. This game has brought me joy, anger, sadness, and many more fun times. This game kept me occupied and ready to pass the time at any given moment. I only with things like upgrades didn't take days, weeks, or even longer. I sure love this game but it gets old, it gets tired. Thanks for the amazing game.",4
Well I like the game but I don't like the update well except the clan capital well first of all when you deploy troops in a battle I don't like the sound it's just like a goblin and second of that the graphics and the sound effect of the building for example when you touch the BK(Barbarian King) or AQ(Archer Queen) its just like the wall sound effect it's so not good but it's a nice game BTW(By The Way) .. Lynx Town Hall 9 Level 7 BK(Barbarian King) Level 7 AQ(Archer Queen) Player Level 42,4
"No updates to builder base in a long time.....takes far too long to update buildings, troops, and spells once you reach TH11. Ridiculous to wait 3 weeks to upgrade. Losing interest daily....scheduling updates during CWL, then the play store not having the update available? Ridiculous. Gameplay and players I have known for years is still fun, but I no longer sp3nd $ on this game. Period",3
"The game itself is super fun, but recently whenever I go to open it up it has something of a 50% chance of crashing. Sometimes it even crashes while I'm playing.",3
"game is awesome, but to play it you need a lot of patience because of the upgrades.Upgrading the x-bow to level 3 takes 5 DAYS and the walls are hella expensive... but it's still awesome.",4
Great game always has been if I was to change something about it would be the fact that you have to wait probably more than a year to complete the game and getting gems is very difficult. BUT that also makes the game good.,5
Since last two days I am opening the game. But it is loading then screen close. I don't want to loose it. I am having clan. I reached town hall 9 .. Many more I don't want to start again... Please help. If I uninstall then I will not download again... Help. I like to play game very much...,5
Absolute amazing game! I've had clash of clans for about 3-4 years and I never found it boring or disappointing. Mechanics are easy and straight forward and no bugs that I know of. This is worth your time.,5
"I miss global chat but this still one of if not the best multi-player mobile game. Also I'm not saying it should be added back since I know what was going on, it was truly disgusting. Personally, I think they should include some if the less terrible reasons it was removed so people stop complaining about it. Sorry about the essay.",5
"It's a lot of fun and it builds and it builds in a builds I've lost three town hall 9s and I spent $4,000 on a couple of them well I spent $2,000 on a couple of them total of $4,000 when I had the money no need spend money on it though you're only cheating yourself if you do it's a lot of fun",4
"This is the best game Ever!! No joke, I've been playing it for 9 years and I don't regret a thing. I've experienced tragedy in losing my account multiple times and experienced true happiness in clan wars and clan games. It is truly the greatest mobile game in the world üåé.",5
"Search takes forever!! You NEED to improve on this if you expect us to pay for training boosts! Searching takes 15-20 seconds at times, which is absolutely ridiculous. Finding a suitable base takes around 20 searches. That's around 6 or 7 minutes lost just sitting around waiting! I expect to hit 15-20 bases in the hour that I PAID for, NOT 10 bases!! I will *not be buying any more gems or amending my review until you fix this issue!",1
"Most noticeable drawback is Barbarian's targeting. It will walk 50 meters to destroy an unimportant structure instead of attacking the wall infront. Monetizing the training speed of units decreases game time. It could've been Barbarian - 1 sec, Archer - 2 sec, Giant 3 sec, Goblin- 4 sec, etc. Maximum simultaneous construction should be increased to 8. Starter free construction should be 3. Modify Treasury resource such that maximizing it will allow 1 hr shortening of all construction.",4
"One of the best games you could ever have on mobile. There have been no bugs since I first started playing and I've been playing for about 5 months now. This game is fun and suitable for all ages. I have started my own clan called the Bush Emus and it's so much fun, if any clash of clans players are reading this don't hesitate to join the crew. Thanks supercell for such an amazing game",5
"Despite I did the recent optional update released, the graphics of the game while zooming in is still low. Clash DEV please bring the high graphics back again, coc isn't enjoyable anymore without it's incredible graphics.",5
"Fun game but I wont be playing anymore. I'm very annoyed. The last 3 clans I joined, as soon as I pitch in for.the new cloud kingdom add on, as soon as I pitch in to rebuild, I spend like 30$ or more on the coins to do so, and once I do they always kick me from the clan. I'm done wasting money on this app. I'll be uninstalling after I post this.",2
It is so fun I have played this my whole life and it never gets old as new troops are added and I have several ideas üí° for some but still I recommend this game to anyone with patience and a brain because it can be difficult to win.,5
"Don't know how I never played this one... The grandfather of all base builders and the best one in my opinion. The time it takes to perform an upgrade is a mechanism to fabricate genuine appreciation. The variety of units, spells, and heroes creates a unique strategic experience. Overall, it's fantastic. A little variety in the hero department would be cool tbh",5
After new update my game cash every time even i can't open to . When i attack in battle black screen appear after clicking in battle and my attack will be waste so please update this bugs and crashes in game and made it like previous ‚ò∫Ô∏è thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
"This get holds a special place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è all my childhood memories. It's very entertaining to play and it's not much of a grind (if you know what you are doing.) This game need (Patience , Strategy and Tactics) if you want to be good at the game. The game has some amazing details and a way array of trooper and each is unique and special in it's on way and buildings and defenses really stand out the best they're are the true highlights of the game it's would get a 10/10 from me!.",5
"Great game and utilizes strategic planning and gameplay. Nothing so far that I have found seems too broken. If you haven't tried out this game, it's worth it 100% (Note: This game is F2P friendly, I have made so much progress just by F2P. Obviously it's gonna go faster if you're P2P, but F2P is also a good option)",5
"Its sick and very nice to play,with so many different heroes and troops. Its a nice strategy game which dosen't take u too far to be addicted too .but the major problem is that it takes a lotta time im kinda bored coz o'that........hope u understand",4
A Great RPG Game! Building Is Awesome and character movement is smooth too. Town hall levels unlock many advancements ; buildings etc. Love the heroes and pets feature. A great overall game.,5
"I find this very interesting and I love the game. I've been playing this for many years . It would be even better if the intelligence of the troops can be enhanced a bit more. Specially when it comes to the heroes, they disappoint me sometimes. üòÑ",5
"Great way to pass time, but upgrades can take a while, town hall 7 and up takes days. If you're looking for a game to battle and destroy other people, you found it.",5
"Regarding Legend League Match making misappropriation and unruly rules to keep only high xp players in Legend League. I have been play coc from past eight years, townhall 11, xp 162. After signing up in Legend, I am getting only xp220 above opponents.This is very unfair as it takes a lot of time to upgrade and this ideology to generate income through in app purchases has negatively affected the Game. For all those who clash for a lifetime, this scenario looks grim as a "" Mega Serial "" .",3
This game is good fun though it's essentially just an idle game with a multi-player raiding system the strategy is simple to understand difficult to master the end game is the same thing over and over however so unless your into round based games it's not anything revolutionary,3
Three stars because the game graphics were excellent but the removal of different voices is not good . On tapping different items the voice coming is soo good but now u have removed that decision is wrong please give back the sound effect,3
"As a seasonal round player I enjoy the game, especially when you find a good clan. No complaints about the game, but I do think that during Clan League War all 7 days should be open to donating, just keep the opponents hidden as if it's the next war day already because as a donator it just makes more sense to be able to fill them all at once",5
"Good game, beside the in-app purchases. Building does take really long when you get further into the game, sadly. But the game is unique and well made. I strongly recommend the game.",4
"It is a fun game and I need some improvementthe only problem is the matching in the builder base, I'm a bh4 going to bh5 and I need the resources to do that so I play battles often I get bh5-7 like what?! I rarely get someone on my level. Look all I'm asking is to fix the matchup problem and I know other players get the same problem as me. I know what your gonna say ""bro u just need to say ""fix the matching problems in the builder base"" u don't have to write a whole paragraph""",4
I just downloaded this game. & right away noticed that the builder hut was 500 gems to buy. So I bought the town hall pack & it went up to 1000 gems needed. Then I bought the builder pack & it went up to 2000 gems needed. The upgrade time is ridiculous. Honestly this is a cash cow game.üòï the amount of gold & elixir needed to upgrade is just plain ridiculous. The gold storage & elixir storage if not upgraded can not hold enough for the upgrades needed FORCING PURCHASES upon us. Truly unfair.,1
"After update, it tells me my Army is ready to take into battle when 2 of 11 units are built. Very annoying. The game knows there are 9 units in the build queue. Also, days and days to upgrade. Boring!",3
Since last update it crashes in middle of battle almost everytime I get on. Nothing to waste resources and ruin your chances of advancement like going to load screen soon as you drop your troops.,1
"It's a good game but supercell needs to do something for people who cannot purchase from the store , because of the region/country they are in. Upgrade time are too long which drag the game and cause it to be boring and frustrating.",4
On of the best games I have played but the bad thing is the game wants a lot gems but when we see that we don't have enough storage and collecting reward like gold or Elixir it just gives 2 or 3 gems but on opposite when you don't have enough gold to upgrade or build it want 50 or 60 gems for same amount please fix this and reduce the amount of gold needed to upgrade walls is over please reduce a lillte bit then I'll give 5 star,4
"Im sorry but your new clan capital update made everything worse. No not the fun experience, i mean my gameplay. I cant even open clan chat because it takes so long to open the keyboard, and then when I do get to type it instantly goes away. I also keep losing connection in battles after I reconnect guess what? I disconnect 4 more times, none of this was happening before",5
This game is really fun. The only issue is that the characters have horrible AI they run into things like the crushers or other very obvious traps. But other than that great game I 100% recommend,4
"I think we need to add a feature for toggling on/off Eye Icon (spectator information) when we attack a base on clan war / cwl. Most people are getting Distracted / Annoyed when attacking with that icon showing. That toggle should be a good feature in setting. Thus, I think it's good if we can sort clan member by War Weight in Clan UI information. So we can know who had the strongest base in the clan, like you sorting people base in regular clan war / cwl. Which no 1 must be the strongest.",4
"it has a great graphics and calligraphy and was great to kill time if you dont have anything to do in home. especially during this quarantine. Hello supercell we happen to encounter a bug in the war where we cant attack the certain player saying that ""You can't attack this player tru again later"" ehat was that?? I'm trying to attack it for almost 2 hours now and yet I cant attack the base. There are 2 player in 30 vs 30. Thanks for fixing the bug but we didn't attain full star because ofthe bug",5
This game is awesome but I can only upgrade 2 buildings in one month. I am now th12 can u fix it try to lower the amount of upgrade in walls and try to decrease the time of upgrade. I love this game but it cause me 100 pesos every week but still not enough cause it takes 2 weeks to finish upgrading please read my rating and I hope you decrease the upgrade time thank you,2
"I love this game, I've been playing this game for 3 years now, why do I give it a three star? well when I am attacking a base their is a text that pop in my screen saying client error not on sinc, I don't know what that means but it's very annoying I've lost so many trophies. Pls fix it. I will change my rating to 5 star if you fix it asap. Overall I love this game.",3
"Been playing this game for about 3 months and absolutely LOVING it. A tip before you download the game is for you to take your time. There is something called ""rushing"" where you put minimal effort into prgressing and upgrade what is called the ""Town Hall"" as high as possible. Make sure you upgrade everything as high as possible. In conclusion, fantastic game, hugely recommend.",5
"This game is great but some more features can be added. In terms of communication, the game is very weak and can expand its chat capabilities. Overall the game is great but poorly communicative.",5
"Really fun and addicting! It does require patience because you WILL fail a lot. Overall, awesome tower defense with lots of chances to play with friends in a clan.",5
"I have updated the app still whenever I open it, it says Good news! New update is available and takes me back to play store where I can only see play open and this cycles continues. My war has started. And I'm going to lose all my attacks",1
"I'm very angry with supercell After this update the game graphics are trash, It look so bad üòû This game is my favourite but graphics need to be improved. Please add a new feature of setting graphics to our wish. Please work on in supercell . Also add a feature to know who is online in clan just like Clash Royale. Although this game is amazing to play and very fun",4
"This game is very awesome and joyful. And, one of my most favorite things about the game is how it doesn't get Boeing and it can be challenging sometimes. And it's also a progression and patient game.",5
"Hellow supercells, Can you guys update about the Warden hero - Indication of Ground and Air.. Because sometimes it's hard to know if it is Ground or Air the icon Is just too small.. This is just A small featured but it will help a lot of player to do and avoid a mistake..",3
"One of the greatest games I've ever played, it is very easy to learn to play and safe. Plus IT DOESNT HAVE ANY ADDS!!!! It the best game I've played, and I'm planning to keep playing for years to come. EDITED: STILL LOVE IT may 2022",5
"This game is just so exciting and fun. You can be in a clan and chat with your friends, at the same time get troops you might need for an attack, etc. You can play a SINGLE-PLAYER MODE against goblin villages, enemies. It even says the recommended town hall level for each goblin map if you are higher or lower. You can participate in clan wars, clan games and even a season pass where you get free loot, should you need it. There are no ads or p2w aspects. I would give this game 10 stars if i could",5
"I like this game very much but there is a problem in the latest update , when u click the wall it makes a sound but now whenever i click anything it makes the same wall sound eg when i click the gold storage or clancastle it makes that sound . I think it is a glich.please fix this please supercell.",4
"First of all not p2w,Secondly you can literaly stop your progress like staying in th10 for mastering attacks or just chlling,Thirdly you can be active anytime it doesnt matter if you been offline for 2yrs(like me but i returned now),Fourth its very productive and fresh if you take a brake you can return back in the game whenever you want, plus progression is soo good in this game i recommend everyone to download this game and share with your friends, im so glad i played this game, give it a try.",5
upgrade takes so much time so new players get bored of this game and left the game . If you decrease the time of upgrades then new players easily can upgrade their village to the max level. It will be more fun then. All tho game is good. ‚ù§,4
"Very fun! Definitely a great time killer, addictive game play and mechanics. However, I have a problem with my troops going and attacking things completely at random, a targeting system of some sort would be great because I've lost countless raids just because the barbarians attack the barracks instead of the mortar cannon or something similar, maybe being able to tweak their favorite target? Like defenses then anything etc like the Hog Riders",4
"Best game ever played. Everything is good. I have only one problem that I am not able to sign-in with the supercell- id. The verification code never comes. So due to this I am not able to sign in. Rest everything is good the king, queen, dragons and everything, all are good. When is the clan capital update going to come.",5
"It's a really enjoyable game since couple years ago. But recently, something changed! Something POLITICAL has been imported to the game. DID SUPERCELL BLOCKED SOME INTERNATIONAL CLAN TAG SEARCH? why I cant search the chinese clan with a clan tag #2QYLP98PY, I'm sure that they are still active, because my friend is in it.",3
"The game personally is very fun. You get to upgrade a lot of stuff and customize your own base. I really like attacking. The only problem that kinda bothers me is you get attacked a lot, for example today I got attacked like 15 times which isn't a big problem, but that's mostly what I think of Clash Of Clans!",4
"Ok, I love this game. Playing with some friends and the teamwork to battle through war. Its just fun. The issue is, I got banned for 2 days due to ""Repeated offenses"". Like what!?! You get ban now just by attacking? I hope that, this was a glitch/bug... But I don't know for sure! Please let me know for what is the meaning of this ""Repeated offenses"" behavior means.",3
It is one of the best games that I've played and i love it but when i updated my phone (poco x3 pro) to miui 13 it doesn't load clash of clans or any other supercell game when i have my wifi on. Although if i have my data on all the games load. I have tested it on other games and apps and my wifi works normally on those. Please try to fix thisüò≠,5
"The game is awsome.I'm very excited to play new update ""clan capital.""butü•≤ü•≤ after new update all the graphics quality reduced.Now i can't see highly detailed troops or buildings in all three villeges including ""clan capital.""Also ""tall grass"" obstacle in builder base seem to be distored.Now game resolution is low and everything is blurred.Supercell please fix this. I'm playing clash of clans since 2016. -Huge clash of clans lover",4
If you choose the button of patience then this game is for you. Because you have to need 3-5 years to end this game.It's just too much time for a building upgradation. However everything was good.,4
"Hello supercell its nice to play your game and today your game is gone unfair everytime my base got attacked this game removes my 30 trophies and the war league sucks th5 gotta attack th14 what the hell your game just need a ""balance"" and its unfair to everyone and also the war machine AI is moronic everytime my war machine faces townhall and its distracted its not coming back to the target like wth? Where are going?? And my war machine ended up died pls fix ur game because its not really fun.",1
Game going crash many times....in the middle of attack ..screen will disappear black ...some time in war attacks.....some time can't see any thing when I was attacking in any base ..... please repair this bug or something,3
Updates sometimes make me uninstal and redownload the game. Still a great game even if you dont want a big committment. I play this as well as keep up on 3 clash royale accounts. If you really like this game however I know people who spend plenty of time and fun managing up to 5 or 6 clash of clans accounts. Fun game overall. Definately recommend.,4
"Very unequal game and the ai is just pretty stupid for a strategy game,you just place them and wait for them to do something but they attack the most useless things.Also the upgrade times are too long.",1
"nice game, no pay to win option of relevance since either way you enjoy the game. note: best strategy is to max lab and use hammers on league army troops. then upgrade TH so that it finises the first day of clan league, then you hammer the lab and get max lvl troops for 5 days. keep doing that until you reach TH 14 or latest lvl. then start upgrading heroes like crazy. that way you spend the least time on the game, since maxed out troops (air troops at the moment) will earn good league medals",5
"I remember this game was simple yet stratigic & super fun but not sure who's deciding these new updates like BB & now this Capital city ""Total Waste"" Rather than improving & addng qol, new fetures to original game like more war tools, different tab for war base challengfe where u can challenge any base any time etc. they r just keep adding non sense stuff which is total mess imo. We alreasy have CG, CWL for rewards & now this Capital city seems total overkill at least for me.",1
"I have been playing this game for 2 years. And I hate its match making algorithm. A lot of us surely noticed it that: (a)When you have extremely low coin and elixir you will find that COC's algorithm is constantly matching you with 3-4 lakh resource bases and when your full of elixir and gold they will constantly match you with 6-8lakh loot. (a)Similarly when you are pushing (th8) they will make sure that crystal III will get Gold III bases, Mster III will get crystal III bases. Its frustrating.",2
This is the best strategy game I have ever played in my life. The graphics are sick and the controls are so smooth. But one problem I am having with the queen. sometimes the queen goes to the side even if I braek the wall in front of her. And the wall breaker also doesn't have that AI. so I will request to improve the AI of the queen and the wall breaker please.,5
"Why some heroes skins are not available after being released on or after its season? Like, we're going to wait after a year before we can get our preferable skins. This make it boring, we're willing to buy and spend gems for it.and Instead, just improve the game fairness of the match, the effects, new updates are appreciated. Also i suggest to put a parking building or something space for the donated troops or siege at the margin space of the home base. I think it would be more great. Ty",3
"Am 65 I luv the game I lost my game a couple of times due changing phones,always able 2 get it back/me personally luv the game plus get a lot of enjoyment!My grands kids put up on the game over 8 years ago!Once again big fan of the clash of the clans!No matter problems I get in 2 they are there 2 walk me turn it!",5
"Less 1 star for supercell pushing out an update in the middle of clan games, and which is not yet available for all at the pkaystore. So I am stuck in a loop...the game says do the update, and the store says I am up to date, making the game inaccessible. Happened on 2021-09-27. Happened again now on 2022-05-02",4
Game crashes frequently. Pressed attack in clan capital and the game crashes.... attack counts even though you cannot even replay it since the app crashed. 0/5 stars. Worthless app if it's dysfunctional,1
"I am 23 and im playing this game since i was 15 and till now i have my last id and im enjoying this game alot. You should all play this game for once , you can be with your friends and you can make your own clan and defeat other clans. I was in school when i started playing this game with my friends. I think for me it was a first perfect game for mobile and for this kind of platform. ,good days never came back but good games should be played ‚ù£Ô∏è",5
"I dont know what mistake did the developers do...After the recent update...my phone screen goes black after i log in the game... I can hear the sounds and background music but i cant see anything!! Please,developers...see to my comment and fix this bug as fast as possible!!ü•∫",1
"Similar to barracks for storing army if there is clan barracks for storing army, and can be used by any clan members when ever they require, instead of waiting for other players to donate. It would be awesome. Amazing cocept of raid medals, which solves the above issue in review, which i have made few weeks back. Great work all the development team.",5
2 stars because it's been up for a while now it's annoying and wasting my time I always get kick out of the game like disconnected to the server something something PLEASE!!!! FIX!!!!! IT!!!!!!,2
"I was playing this game for almost 1.5 years and didn't have any problem with the game but your security system is the worst my I'd is hacked and I am not able to recover it. So,I am uninstalling it now, this is the worst at least in other games we have account security üò°",1
"Amazing game that I've been playing for years, however I have one complaint: the upgrade times are too long and should be cut straight in half.",4
"Meh, then annoying... I recently logged back in after another few months off but I've played this game since my iPhone 4 days so I know the notifications are not too bad however... Supercell is now lying to me! I bought a seven days sheild and it's still got 4/5 days left on it, stop telling me I'm being raised just so I'll open up the app! It's happened twice now and I can't be attacked while my sheild is active and when I log back on there was no attack. I'd like an explanation please..",2
I used to play all the time when I was younger and just recently picked it back up and re-downloaded. I'm really enjoying it the only real complaint is the upgrade and build times but it's kinda a big strategy game and can add to it!! Highly recommend for something to do or pass the time or anything!,5
"After upgrading laboratory please give some benefits of that level up not just an formality to level up our troops but also some benefits like some 5-10% time reduction. Also, many players take too much to complete even th7 and 8 due to shortage of gold. So, please give one clan storage, in this, every player attacks on bases. Whatever they collect only a little part of it would be collected to that storage and later by the end of any particular time, that fund should be distributed in equal.",3
I've been playing this amazing game since a decade now. Had started playing right after its release and it has me stuck to it like glue. Over the years the content has improved a lot and I hope to see more and more every year,5
"It's a very fun game I recommend its my all time favorite game you get to make your own city. And be in clans with your friends and other people there is a lot of things to attack with like a air balloon with a skeleton in it if that's not cool there is a hog rider, dragon and evan a lot more.",5
"This game is the BEST!, But the problem is that the builders do not upgrade/build when they are done with the last upgrade, so alot of time is wasted, but still that does not stop me from playing this game.",4
"Hey Clash of Clan or super cell! After a long year i quit on this game, i finally played it again. But there's just a little bit problem. My frustrations of this game hunting me again. First, is the match making of the versus battle in the builder base. Second, the global chat is gone! Too lonely in the clan there's a few people you can talk and makes me feel boring while when theres global chat before i can talk to someone easily.",2
"This game is good but in recent times, The game is using ""high mobile data"". Then, It doesn't utilise this much data but now why it is happening I just don't understand. I thought it is the problem of this phone so then I installed this game in another phone but the same thing is happening. I didn't expected this from COC.",1
"This game is fun and addicting, but once you get further in, it takes longer to progress into it, and at this point, I've spent at least one million on in-game purchases because I'm not patient, so unless you are a very patient person, or have a lot of money to spend, don't get really far into this game, because you'll find yourself spending money that you don't have. In some ways that's an insult, but in most, it's a very huge compliment. Have fun!",4
I've been playing off and on for years one of my favorite games to kill time. The waiting process sucks To upgrade things But they brought the Mini game in so that's pretty fun.,5
It's really fun you get to fight in epic battles and upgrade your village. I recommend this gameüòÜüòäAnd these sort of good quality graphics are really rare now days so get the game and you won't regret it and if you like biulding and fighting in strategy games you'll like lt! !!!!!!!!üòÜüòÑüòÉ‚ò∫üòäüòÄüòÅ,5
"The game is classic. It a perfect 5 star game. But the only down side is the delay of updated version. I'm from india and here, the game suggests to download the update but when clicked on update guess wt, there is no update. As I said a really gud game just need a Lil bit of polishing in the software n release of updates",3
"After spending thousands of dollars over 8 years of playing this game, I forgot my supercell ID (even though it was saved on my Google play) and which email I used for it. I got banned from the game while trying to recover my village by contacting customer support. I will never have another supercell game on any of my devices again because of this experience.",1
Great game with amazing graphics and complex strategies. The main game is very awesome as well as the new clan capital mode has made this a bit more better than the old one. Keep growing the game. No one can be bored from this. Thanks you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,5
App is having some issue. It doesn't work on mobile data . Only it works if connected to wifi network. Not sure why it is so. Have been facing this issue recently. Pls solve.,1
"i have been playing since 2014. My complaint is that the upgrades are too expensive and time to upgrade my TH to max has taken me 8 years and I still have 200 walls left to upgrade. Now they have introduced the Central Hall. This is a pyramid of bases that have ruins on, these need Central Hall gold to repair or upgrade. Your clan works as a team to upgrade and fight other bases from Fri to Mon. This has same issues, expensive and time consuming, even with the clan sharing the work load.",4
The game itself is awesome i recommend it but on my samsung a10 it crashes on tje loading screen its very rare to actually get into the game bit if you manage that it will crash in about 10min i tried everything to fix it but there isn't a way,4
Very good game for anyone who likes strategy type games and the only bad thing i don't like is if you have high trophy points it gives you opponents who have more buildings or who is way to high level for you,5
Got notification to update the game the update isnt working and so I cannot update or play. Looks like only one option to uninstall which means I lose everything but from reading the reviews it seems this will continue to happen. Is it possible to please fix this issue??? The game was great until the update screen popped up and stopped everything from working.,5
"An excellent game. Playing it for about 4,5 years. However if it has some more options rather than attacking and training. It could be alot more fun to play.",4
"The game tends to frequently crash several minutes into playing it which unfortunately results to most of my attacks to fail,I it is extremely annoying now, please fix this problem.",1
"I'm playing this game ,Since 2015 and honestly this is the best game I've ever played .....And the most facinating part of this game is it's Animation and graphics . This is the only game which you cannot forget about it whenever you install this game again and again this becomes better and better..........Thank you supercell for creating this masterpiece..... it's 2022 now but still it hits different whenever i play............#cocforever ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Just grtting started, but it's pretty good. But is there a way to get rid of the black dots that block the view. Looks like they are some kind of a control for a plug in game control. I'm using Bluestacks on a laptop.",5
"I updated my game a few hours ago and everything is not on the highest quality as it was before things are a bit blurry and unclear.I can still see objects but not as I saw it before the updated version,my phone's quality is on the highest and thus only occured after the update.Please COC developers attend to this!",1
"Quite good but only 1 suggestion. SUPERCEL PLEASE ADD SUPPORT FOR MAC. I've been playing this game for years, and it would be perfect on mac or any other pc. Plus it would expand the player base, and make like an afk game too",4
This app is phenomenal because it makes you keep coming back to upgrade and gain trophies. And I have been playing this game for years over years from one account to another and overall I think this app is more than worth every Megabyte.,5
"Coc has become complicated over time ..its pains to see the newbies reach th 9 in weeks when we struggled for months...star bonus,clan games,clan war league and mainly those magic items...even though these features are a lot to take in...they sure did improve the game...and when they reduce the building or upgrading time in the game and u have already upgraded that specific item...u feel like its not fair...maybe they should give a magic item to help us cope up with the balance upgrades!üòÄ",5
"This game seems to be less fun the more they update it. I've been an adamant player for around 6 years, and I've noticed that my troops being max completely at TH12 are utterly useless. It is absolutely ridiculous that max level troops are so weak they cannot even 1 star a base much lower than me. The troop AI is such bs. They will literally leave a funnel to walk the entirety of the base and get killed by defense. Unless this is fixed, there really isn't a point to the game.",2
"Broüòá honestly, this game changed my entire life, still its the best strategy game existed in the earth, like an oxygen for me. üò∑ Now I'm struggling to get good grades in exams tho, but it was all my fault, I'll never blame the game for this, just one thing to say: ""Never get super addicted in it, don't be harsh with your IRL life,, relatives, friends for a silly game, they are the real ones"". Then you are AOK.‚ù§Ô∏èüåøüåº",5
"I love this game, i play it all the time, but after this new ""update"" everytime I open the game it tells me there's a new update and brings me to the play store, but the only options are play and uninstall, I tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it but it does the same thing, fix this please? Your update and new added features clearly made the game not work in the first place",3
"New update is trash and pointless. Only good thing about it is getting rid of maxed out ""builder hall"" coins cause it's been maxed out for bout a yr. Should have upgraded builder halls or did something with that instead. Or even came out with new characters n replaced older unused ones. Minions, baby dragons, headhunters! üòí",2
"It's a very good game if your looking for a village themed game with strategy and planning genre game. Although it takes time ,It's a pretty great game. Just wish Supercell make the updates a little less storage taking.",5
"You have to be very rich to play this game. After certain lvl the build time , the upgrade time , everything is exuberantly high , forcing you to either leave the game or pay for everything. People will hate this in the long run. So better don't start this game.",1
"amazing customer support. i lost my account and they helped me reactivate it. the instructions to get it working weren't very clear and i had to use a different email address for my old account, but i got it back and there was a little Easter egg too, thank you.",5
When I open it it keeps saying there is a new update avalible however it it not needed to play the game as I can click anywhere to exit it. When it pops up it only has one button that says update but not an exit/stop asking button as if it is trying to get me to update despite not wanting to update. 2 stars,2
"i played this game 6 years ago, i just playing again for a month now but unfortunately i accidentally loss the application, i contacted the tech support and i was really ""amazed"" how they help me recover my account even though its still not linked to any email. this game never fail to amazed me, still one of the best game i ever played. thank you coc and supercell ü§ôüëåüíØ",5
"this is a good game, however the game id is getting expired and you need to put the code again. when adding the latest code youll get an error shows invalid code. I did try the recommended troubleshooting but still getting the error. now its hard for me to log in my other account. one more thing no help center for urgent help. im thinking not to continue playing this.",1
"i have been playing this game since 2015 i had lot of fun making friends, attacking other village with strategies and building own village into empire. with the new update of Capital Peak i am active more than before its addictive in good way i think in new update coc team should have added one more builder for looking into Medals. overall these years i have been enjoying this game i love it.",5
Amazing game! It takes a while to get good and level up. The the attacks rely heavily on strategy and game knowledge. There is no ads on this game which makes it a must have!,5
"Unbelievable! At first slow start but the more I played, the more I wanted to play! Funny characters and story love it! With options to customize your bases!",5
Amazing and fun game. I 100% recommend this game to all. I've been a player since th 11 was max lvl and this game today still gives me that joy and excitement of grinding it or just playing. Constant updates and events are what make this game fun to play. In my opinion it's the fact tht supercell actually cares about its players and the game itself.,5
"Great game ive been playing this game since grade 6. But i uninstalled it when im at town hall 7. Now that im grade 10 i reinsalled it beacause i missed playing it , and when i did i im surprised in its new update where your buildings and everything just upgraded themself and i even attacked my own base with my own troops . and here i thought i would start all over again.. Gotha LoveThis GameüòÇ",5
"I like the game because we can attack other villages and once we built ours villages... it that I see .. its the first one that I am playing this game since 2 week .., I could playing the game but I should play Clash of Clan .in the there also a boat that I need to build when my Tower Hall was upgraded .. I attacked another village üòî üò≠ but there are I loss.I can earn most money üí∞ in the Gold storage and in the Elixir storage I can. collet Elixir . I used those things my villages most great.",2
"faulty update, now I have to start over, after a year of play and advancement. Horrible app, here we go again this really sucks, not even going to waste my time or money anymore, another faulty update 4/2/22. one year later aging üñïüñï",1
"Absolutely love the game. And I'm very glad they patched the loading screen bugs. I was always able to login pre-update, but everytime I have an app like Spotify playing in the background, it would always crash it. Now it's completely fixed and I'm very much pleased. Much love to you guys in the Clash Team!",5
"We can't even play the game anymore. It takes years to upadate your heroes why? We can't participate in the war while we update heroes, we can't attack we can do nothing while heroes are updating. Please do something so that we can upadate heroes but still attack with it. The game is getting really boring, you just wait collect resource from events and treasury and update your heroes and defences.. I don't even play the game anyomore just wait. Try to understand we can't even play the game.",1
I built my base up pretty high and now they wont let me go any higher unless I build what they want.... I refuse to build walls!!! Now I can't go higher =( Please allow me to progress my way not everyone else's way. I like to challenge myself and be unique.,1
the game is easy to start but it takes time like u have to upgrade everything and every upgrade takes time expect the wall upgrades! some tips: dont spend all of ur gems bc u need it to buy new builders (so u can upgrade more things at the same time!) u should repair the clan castle bc then u can play with ur friends or join random clans! shortly: the clan castle allows u to join clans and help ur clan mates or they help you! i hope u will have a lot of fun playing this gmae!,5
Im will uninstall this game if the problem will be not solved.i have palyed it for 10 years .but after the new recent update the game is not opening or the screen is black .it also happens with new village and also in war time .plz do something for it .don't tell that midrange phone can't handel it(redmi 8a) Thank you .do some solutions,3
It's very great Game! But there is little suggestion for this game. 1 - Add the option for upgrade or build next which used for upgrade the building or resources after current upgradation was finished. Hope This improvement Will Help. ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
This is an awesome game. Pretty fun to just see how far you progress since the beginning from the game and how there's always stuff to do with the many updates it receives. Definitely a recommendation from me!,5
"After figuring out the latest update by turning my wifi off and using data to get it started, the game is yet again a very addicting game! Great job with the update! **Currently waiting for a refund as I was double charged for the Gold Pass after purchasing post-update. Hope this gets resolved soon.",5
"Its a very time consuming game, though overall fun when it comes to the war leagues and wars, i think the game could have more minigames for prizes as the builder hall is boring and the campaign not being enjoyable.",4
It's really good game I enjoyed alot while playing this But sometimes when i open the game my screen suddenly goes black and restarting game also doesn't help Even clearing data didn't help I am facing this problem from so long Most of the xiomi phone users are facing this So i hope you will fix this bug or problem soon,4
It's clash everyone knows it's good that's all I have to say but only problem in my opinion is that sometimes when you log into supercell it doesn't give you the email but just keep trying and when it tells you to use gems in the tutorial don't I don't spend money on the game and im about to have 3 builders huts at town hall level 4 maybe 5 if I have to save up from 2 town halls but if you only save your gems for builders huts it's much better.,5
"The game is broken after the update - The graphics suck. - Sound effect problem (All building and walls sound the same when click on, all troops sounds the same when deployed.)",1
"Good game, been playing for about 6-8 years total, the only thing I don't like about the game is the ""battle pass"". I don't generally like battle passes in games, but at least this one is fast, easy to gain levels, and gives decent rewards for non-paid players. I recommend this game to others if you want something fun to do in your spare time.",4
"Very boring when you have to wait more than 5 days to upgrade something is lost the desire to play, but this game does just that, or buy with money and everything is upgraded quickly or wait for days and some things with a week or more",1
"The game is very awesome, it's easy to play and it's fun. The only thing is, you have to wait for days and hours to upgrade your base. That's what I found really disappointing, but the updates and everything is awesome. I rate this 4 Star! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê. ü§©",4
"Changing my review. The last update with the Clan Capital is dumb. If I wanted to play and a different game I would have moved on. Adding a 3rd game within this game that is not very fun was bad decision. I have 2 maxed th 14s, no more gold pass for me and I might sell my accounts soon.",2
"Till now I love this game. I've been playing this game for about 7 years now but still I have long way to go to maxed out my village. For free gamers like me, it would really takes time to max. I just hope that upgrade time would be reduced. 7-14 days is just toooo long.",4
It is a good game with good graphics and physics. The only thing I dont like about the game is how for example I am a Town Hall 7 and a Town Hall 9 just attacked me. So what I'm saying is if you could change it so only the same town hall can attack you.,5
"By far The Best Mobile Strategy Game ever built on mobile devices. F2p or p2w, it doesn't really matter. Very fun to play. Lots of free items to help speed up your progress. Lots of event every week. The game keeps improving. Lots of Content creator are covering this game.",5
"Hello Clash of Clans team, I like the game, I really do. I started playing your game way back 2014(2015) I think and so does my friends, we have a lot of fun back then. If I may, I would like to you to add 1 or 2 more builders for the main village, I would really appreciate that. I'm still playing your game though and I still love it. Thank you for creating the game and keep on doing what you are doing hehe.",5
I always get opponents with a higher builder hall level than mine. Is this a feature in this game? No matter how good your troops are if they are not compatible with the opponent's base with more defense than yours then you will continue to lose.,1
"After the maintenance break, the app won't load anymore; the required update won't push through! It's so annoying, especially that there's an on-going clan war league! Grrrrr!üò°üò°üò°",1
I still love this game but the problem is the new update glitch or loading problem it is not letting me play the game I have looked it up on YouTube and found out that it was happening to some other players as well and I have try all the things but it is still not opening When ever I open it. It take me back to my home screen plz plz plz fix this,3
"Game stated there was an update. Went to the play store, no update. Refreshed the game, app, and restarted mobile device. No joy. Tried to contact developer but it's either an automated response or they require you player id which is in the game.... It's a fun game and would like continuing to play.",1
Very good the details are nice and love the new update then i updated it and the buildings and the scenery is a bit blurry when you look close at a building or the scenes it gets a bit blurry even the places where you deploy troops plsüôè fix thisü§óüôè,5
"Since the new update, the game no longer runs on my Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite tablet. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice, crashes as soon as you try to run it, says it has a software bug.",1
"Pretty good game. I started like 5 or 6 years ago, but that was on an old tablet that I had, and I got to town hall like 12, but I no longer have that tablet or the log in info. But it is extremely fun to start over and rebuild your village.",5
"The thing i hate is that whenever my connection gets cut just even only for a second the game automatically restarts,this often happens when im on battle and when it automatically restart my attack gets ruined and I lose trophies",4
"I could give it a 5 of u could only bring back the global chat or make new ways to connect with others outside clan. And also Im still hoping for more exciting updates, not just a plain and boring additional defences and levels. supercell. please. EDIT: From 3 to 4 star because of the New clan capital update. It's Great Thank you Supercell ^_^ üëç",4
This is a great game. Fun to play but if you want to upgrade your town hall or something else's level then it would take 2-5 hours just to upgrade but at the end this is a nice and fun game.,4
"It's really a quite good game, but problem is with the upgrades, it takes a lot of time give any upgrade so please solve or else it's just perfect.",3
"Team, Kindly update the app version for Android app because infinite loop appearing when user tries to update the app. Update button in play store is not getting displayed. Thanks!",1
Fun game but the developers need to work on the troop AI more and figure out how to buffer a little so I don't get disconnected every time my phone switches from WiFi to mobile data and back.,3
Great Game since the release. Too addicting even when I was a child. There is a problem though...War Matchmaking. In the Current Clan War League. My clan is suffering from high leveled TH. We have only 3 or 4 Lvl 12 TH while the enemy's is 30+! How can we even win?! So if possible please organise your war matchmaking. Thank you for the game.,5
"Amazing game, decent graphics, fun gameplay. This game is very addictive and a great way to pass time. It also is very fun to watch the little villagers clap at trees. Honestly when I started writing this review I couldn't think of ANY downsides. At this point I can think of 2. One that although it isnt p2w due to you not getting hindered by anyone paying, people who do pay progress much faster Second is that you have to wait ages for buildings to finish. Otherwise I recommend you download now.",4
I may not be the best player..but when I attack to get 6 trophies and get attacked to loose 25 trophies..but then a special offer to buy something..pay to win..the only reason I'm playing is to waste time while I'm trying to sale my house and all my tools are in storage,2
This game is realy fun if you put your time into it you can get realy far. It does get annoying sometimes but you just have a to put that behind you and do the tutorials and the practice.,5
"I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!!...It's like we play using our mind. Strategy is the most player use when attack other player in this game. I have an idea for this game that really useful and wanted from all players. Add something that clanmates could donate resources such as gold, elixir, dark elixir and gems. I suggest this cuz it will help people with their village and troops. It's really hard to max everything up cuz of low resources and if u trying to attack other, ur troops ez died cuz low lvl.",5
"Game is fun to play and I enjoy it. However, recently I can not load onto the app. The progress bar gets stuck at 75% then the game crashes",5
"The game is very good i even bought gold pass but it keeps crashing for no apparent reason, sometimes for switching to builder base, sometimes opening a menu, and new Capitol update i cant even open the game jeez",2
I like this game and I play too much nice game. But the worst update in the clash of clans history because supercell has removed the sound of creatures like defense that's why I am giving supercell 4 stars. The old update is better then new. And also graphics become bad when new clan capital update came.SUPERCELL brings the sound of creatures like defense I will give clash of clans 5stars. That's why OLD IS GOLD.,4
"I recommend to add different map so that it's not boring and also add some civilization to choose to make it more interesting. by doing this, you can encourage your old players to play this game again",3
"Words is just the problem. Keep the dormant accounts, that is one of the strokes of smarts with this game. The removal of global chat prevented bullies and trolls who destroyed games of single and group playing combinations. Ranking system and rewards make the game fun and rewarded everyone better. As most other games will never see old active people return really. Keep on moving forward. My post is one star. Future ... decide...",1
"Awesome game and I am almost playing it from past five to six years. Everything in the game is very good but the only thing the game management need to focus is to bring diffrent war zones and other stuff which makes the game more interesting now it is just based on traing,base desingning,attacking and upgrading there must be some more things to do in the game.",4
"2May2022, updated COC but game is not loading. It keeps showing update is available, clicking update, it leads to playstore where uninstall or play are the options. When clicking play, it again shows update is available. What's wrong?",2
"I like the fact that you don't need to uninstall the game because you're about to be out of storage. bruh storage is a big problem in the past and because of that I've been playing this since I'm a little, I'm th14 now (. ‚ùõ ·¥ó ‚ùõ.). The graphics of the game is the same as how i raid a village, I'm really good at .",5
"Everything is good. But we play coc for many years, but If we play on multiple device it gets locked so that all the years time spent and work done is becoming waste so please help me to get unlock code. And please here after atleast give the warning before locking so it will be helpful please consider this review and take the necessary steps. I tried to get the help from the in-game but i am not getting the real human support and the conversation with the bot automatically ends without reply.",4
"This new capital mode is an excellent gameplay! But there is something that I want coc to update are clan house and thatched, their looks are not changing even if we upgrade our halls and it doesn't looks good. The more halls we upgrade the more beautiful clan house and thatched hut looks better Wil be a better Idea.",4
"Great game, little to no performance issues, and it's great for if your not on your phone all the time. The progression is fun and rewarding, it just takes time. If you have that time, this game would be great for you.",5
"This game is one of the best, but ugrading in laboratory annoys me a bit, i wish developers should allow 2 ugrades in lab to make it a lil faster,i have already maxed out my def,heroes and buildings but the troops and spell upgrades really takes a lot of time, i hope the developers sees this.thank you",4
Boring as it ever was. Nothing to do just upgrades. Events are clearly not tracked just set to go off at specific times. No devs running this game just taking the money you'll throw at it still. I can't believe samurai seige has gone all we got left with was this tittle tattle. Disgraceful,1
"The game ai for your troops is horrible. They will continue attacking buildings and resources ,while taking hits. Dragons for example could easily take out a tower; instead they absorb hits till their killed, while they focus on destroying a wall.",3
I playing this game for a long time I faced many issues in game like my connection is good but it always show network error and 2nd I cant open my account and say reinstall the app supercell fix this error in game it make game so frustrating and lose many trophies due to these error,1
"After update,graphics and sound is fully changed. Graphics becomes of low quality & every building that I tap it sound like tapping on wall & when I upgrade them it sounds like object removed but getting no gems. When bowler dies it sounds like barbarian is dead & same thing happens to healers sounds like archers, itz funnyüòÇüòÇ, but please fix these glitches. There are so many sound glitches I cant explain everything in this post so I request Supercell to fix these glitches as far as possibleü•∞",5
"I'll give you 5 stars if you fix this crashing game, always crashing when I open it. Your game is broken! I can't even play it! Your game always breaks down unlike my other games. Your game is like a Virus !",1
"FIX THE BATTLE MACHINE. It's absolutely so stupid, it will get distracted by outside obstacles (obviously no problem with that) but if there are troops in play it will not go inside the base, it will be attracted to another building 50 ft away from it. As soon as the troops are all gone all of a sudden it gets the brilliant idea to go attack a crusher. It is so dumb, sometimes it ignores the defenses in front of him and decides to march past and attack a random elixer collector. IT'S ANNOYING!",3
This is a good game with complex strategy with good graphics but a problem i ever seen when I open the game black screen is coming this is happening from 3 days when clan capital is come and it's very irritating me so I want to tell the supercell pls fix this is this was fixed i give 5 stars,3
"Everything is good,i am playing this game for last 5 years,it deserves 5 star,,,but its the upgrade timer,please reduce the upgrade timer,,,many players of my knowing play other games because they dont like the very large upgrade timer,,reduce it all to half,,and the game will be perfect,more old players will also come back as well as new players will also join",2
"I've been playing Clash of Clans for a few years. The opponent matching system needs improvement, and the character intelligence could be better. Many of the characters, like the Grand Warden will be attacking a building, then randomly change to another building without finishing the last building, and while being attacked by an even closer defensive building.",3
"Mf this app. I maked th.9 and then it is not opening.throw back coc üñïüñïüñïüñïI am saying it openly.mf coc ///sorry for these words but these were appropriate at that time I made town hall 9 max with 6 months and then black screen was there only, but now through youtube I solved my problem but app didn't fix it I fixed it with the help of you tube , biggest setback of coc servers, Even now many people are facing these problems.... Like blackout screen , restore andany more....",1
"Most time consuming game I've ever played. You'll almost never be 100% max without spending money. But it's not a p2w game. Lot of content for a mobile game, which is impressive. They separate their paid content and paid progression well with their skill base.",5
"Im bugged, can't log in to your game, also the audios in the game are broken since the clan capital update, the roaster's audio are 5 multi mortars firing, troops having too early audios, broken audios at home village... please fix this i can't log back in, I'll change my review once its fixed. :(",2
Love the game But I have experienced a decent amount of bugs Like My supercell verification code not being sent and not being able to buy stuff which is still happening right now I would put it at 4 stars for that but for all i know it could be my fault that it wont work but But its still a good game,5
"Clash of clans is an amazing game with lots of content. However in the new Clan Capital update I have found a few small bugs. ‚Ä¢All sceneries and villages appear blurry and lower quality. ‚Ä¢Builder base attack theme continues to play even after an attack has finished. ‚Ä¢Events sometimes do not load, This one is not update specific because I've had this issue before this update.",3
I like this game ..very...much... The character in the game are very realistic ..and i love ...Archer girl ...and the hood man... This is game is suitable for all...age above +6... It's graphic level in the game is quite intresting and little different from playing other games... The level of thinking is great for everyone... Ok... anyway... Enjoy the game... Game is just a game ...!!!,5
its a great game for entertainment and time killer keep it up guys keep on updating Clash of Clans. The reason why i rate it 4 stars because sometimes the Clan war and Clan War League search is not balance it is not appropriate opponents hope you can fix it thank you.,4
"loved it a lot, but please improve the time settings! I mean upgrade time that take days is just too boring, that too when the potions are costly as heck and last only for an hour.",5
A great game with good mechanics and based on how you design your how you defend and how you attack but you should add some stuffs so we could help our friends to max out there bases. Over all the is great and have lots of things to do,5
"Sick and tired of the stupid Battle Machine walking around 1000 walls just to stand next to a Crusher doing nothing, it literally loses 70 HP just to get to a random location which makes no sense because the Battle Machine should destroy every type of building but in my case on multiple occasions he walks around tanking every hit for no reason, at first i tought he was going for the defense troops but no actually, he'a just stupid asf and he does that on multiple occasions",1
"Recent updates were not very happy Becoz all troops were been weeken and not loot was been given and in war the level of opponent was higher than our levels and compete with them and winning is very difficult, update must be new and exciting but here all were been turn upside down please rectify it or we gonna uninstalled this game.......... Why league medals were been reduces points are also reduced ,, .............always higher gift items were been kept in last points in clan games",3
"THE ABSOLUTE WORST customer service experience. Contacting customer support is a waste of time; they take out promotional offers before they expire, and without reason, and if you ask them to sell you that offer again, they will simply ignore you. Unless you have a simple question, which answer you can find on YouTube, there is nothing pleasant about interacting with them. Try asking them for a real request so you can prove it. They violate their own fair game rules and the Google Play policy.",1
Alot of waiting but still really fun EDIT: Its been about 2 years and this game is still fun. The only problem is that it takes 9 days to upgrade things sometimes but it is still pretty fun.,5
"It's only right that upgrading buildings takes a long time because upgrading is very expensive, so even if the upgrading takes a long time, you can accumulate coins I love this üéÆ game",5
"Release the fix update please. This new update is unstable. The game keep crashing. My phone version is up to date. I've tried clearing cache, restarting my phone, but nothing happen. Fix the game.",1
it's a great game been playing it for years but for the first time i have an issue with it. after the clan capital update the game sometimes crash and it freezes my phone making me not able to exit the game so yeah that's it,4
The games good but it sucks when you're saving for the next town hall upgrade and you keep getting raided 24/7 and lose your savings and I'm glad they made it fair with money transactions you can if you want to get further easier in early game but I didn't and now I'm pretty op for grinding so ovarral 4 stars,4
"Fun game , but everything they have an upgrade you never know what kinda problems come with . The latest one .can't sign in. Stuck in upgrade and play mode. Annoying",3
My app is not working properly since yesterday(5 jan) . It isn't able to load and is severely lagging and disonnecting... kindly fix it soon I have to attack in cwl.. I don't wanna miss my attack... I'll edit my rating as soon as the problem is fixed.. please hurry up the war is about to end.,4
Good game and it's really fun. Only complaints are that it takes a while to upgrade stuff because you can only have 2 things going(based on how many builders huts you have).,4
It is not good when we play builder base they clash my town with fully upgraded townhall of opponent which have one or two level ahead of me. Due to this i continuously loss my trophies.,2
"The supergoblins are just the most unfair thing on this game..they always get to the townhall, therefore making one star..steal all of the resources, and dont even give you a shield, since the total damage is so low. I got raided 4 times in a row by them! In a 20 mins time frame..lost a lot of points! Lame lame lame",1
As what I've experienced In this game it is very better in a way that it relieves all of my sadness because of making some layout to overcome my sadness. But what I have in mind is that when lagging my lag it Will be reset from the top that makes me go insane. I think next time it will be better for the coc to have its own load,5
"Very awesome game the experience and thrill this game gives is awesome, you got to plan, build and control your area while defending and invading others. One of the best games to plan if you love strategy",5
"it was a fun game, still is really, but this MAJOR bug has RUINED the ENTIRE game, one day I just opened up and saw I had NEGATIVE 500 gems?!?! Only thing I did before that was Buy a Builder Potion for 25 Gems in the Merchant Shop, But when I woke up the next day and got on, It destroyed my gems, I can't even get the free potions cause it's bugged, This Bug makes the game a 1/10, Please Fix that, and honestly that's all. Can't do anything AT ALL without them, No Speed up, refill, anything...",1
So I have been playing this game for quite awhile it's really fun but it might just be me but once I click on the app and on the loading screen it just sends me back to home screen I have been trying to fix it by resetting my phone any ideas how to fix it that I'm missing,4
"The sound afx of the game like tapping the building, sending the troop and yell its battle cry,and when completing the level of the troop and build is getting weird and different fix this and I'll give a five star if you read this review.",3
"Pay to win, spend years waiting time for false progression. I have spent more than $100.00 USD, paid for the monthly season pass multiple times. Every cent a waste for this money hungry app.",1
This game is best. It's my favorite game. Problem 1. Remove world chat is the main reason for a clan slow growth. 2. Bug and gleatch is so many. 3. Graphics are so low. (It now 2022) Graphics is stop game growth Supercell hopefully are notice this please do something . Thanks,1
"Easy 5 stars, one of the best games I have ever played and is amazing if you love basebuilding and strategy type games. I recommend it to anyone 5 and older just because I feel like it would be really complicated for anyone 4 or younger. I really can't find any complaints or struggles with this game to share, because there simply are none.",5
I love to play clash of clan but it taking a lot of time to reload but you should update more so best experience in clash of clans. If you change upgrading time it will be great.please guve more benefits to those who didn't had purchased gold pass .decrease the gold pass cost .i want to purchase gold pass but the amount is not resonable .thanks for corporations. I hope understood my problem you would upgrade more and provide more benefits to those who didn't had purchased gold pass .hope so.....,3
"Edit: i got my account back and its so great. It took almost 4 yrs and they did nothing but it worked somehow. But here is a change in review. i liked the game very much, the one thing i got frustrated is when my account got linked to someone else and now i got start from square one.. i contacted them for 2 years and all they say is we will get you back ur account and i got fed up with them... give me my account back and the rating will be changedüëä",5
"I'm so sorry for a 1 star, but the reason is because of the new update. It is not the actual content, it's the download. I can't download it because it is putting me in a loop of percentage. Example is that it finishes, but resets to 40. I don't have an answer to why this is happening. I can't play the game anymore unless this is fixed.",5
"i love this game. Amazing graphics, strategy planning, base building and many more amazing and ORIGINAL ideas. But only reason i gave it 4 stars as when new th keeps adding new players found it difficult to progress. Only people who can progress are old players playing from global launch or who spend money. Well we can't do anything about that but i guess you should come up with something to make it easy for new players. i hope the devs read this as the game is close to being dead in future.",4
"Keeps telling me to update when ive already updated. I cannot load the game, im leading a clan and need access asap.. fix nowüò° Edit: once again I find myself unable to load the game after your update. Its telling me to update when I already have. Have uninstalled and im still getting the same message. Fix this now! Its beyond a joke Edit- Once again . Same problem. New updateüò°",1
"I can't open the game. When I try to launch the game it loads then kicks me out. I was upgrading to town hall 9 or 10 then the game updated and now it won't let me in. Edit, I am able to open it now and I have been sense a couple days after I sent the original review. Sorry it took so long to respond.",5
"Its very interesting play this game , but the problem is= why witch level 1 hp 300 but wizard level 10 hp 230 , supercell please fix it , why boy is weaker than girl? And another problem is= can you make bomb cost is a little bit cheap? It's not a good value upgrading bomb for only increase under 30 damage using millions of gold, I'm so frustrated that I'm not a rusher so I have to upgrade all of the bombs for not good value. Thank you if supercell fix this",4
"4 star Its a great game dont get me wrong and its winderful, i rated it 4 stars because of the crashing. It craahes when im on the losding screen and it gets annoying so i have to delete and re-install again just to play",4
"Make the game more fair especially on builder base. Builder hall 6 or 7 vs builder 9? Wherever you look at it is completely different. Those who have higher bases does have higher grade defenses and TROOPS. Even u are good at attacking theres no chance you'll have a fair battle against those are higher. It is challenging and exciting even you lost to a ""matched"" base. But those who are higher? Ask others what they think.",1
This game is good and challenging for us and A little bit exciting when you go to the other level of town hall new troops and new defense it is nice to see the graphics of the game eventhough the upgrading is longer the more excitement you gainüòäüòäüòä,5
"I like the game. I've been playing it for years. The reason why i gave it 3 stars is because ever since that one specific update, the game is so laggy now. The game crashes and heats up my phone immediately after just a few minutes in to the game. I don't know what's the cause. Perhaps it would be fixed if there's a setting to lower the graphics.",3
"Love the game, but can not bring it to 5 Stars for now. I don't understand why it cost so much to build a wall. You would think for 1,000,000 gold or elixir it would upgrade a larger section then 1 block of the wall.",4
"It's a great game but the match making sucks, it'll match you with higher TH and the loot you gain is so damn low,but when they attack you they'll get so much loot and trophies, IT IS VERY UNFAIR.",3
0 stars. I contacted support to change my email address and after several days of back and forth and providing all of the information they requested(several times) my 3 accounts were locked and they are now telling me there is nothing more they can do and my accounts are locked forever. I noticed that everytime support responded to my information or questions there was a different name on the response from supercell. You are not talking with the same person or bot throughout your issue.,1
"honestly, i dont like the latest update coz, every member of the clan must participate in these clan capital thing. but the thing is, most of us have jobs so, not all can contribute to this. plus, these added update only makes d game time more time consuming and boring.. i love clash of clans, but the maker of these capital thingy makes me feel bored about the game.",3
"Someone else have access to my account. I never share my account to anyone. I got this suspicious login since i connect my gmail to supercell ID. Supercell ID is bad, never ever connet you gmail to suppercell ID or your account will less secure. Already contact by email to customer service but has didnt solve the problem. The fiture from otto bot in menu setting-help also didnt help. When i try to disconnect my gmail with supercell id itd always failed with several useless reason. SUCKS",1
It's good but.. I have a little problem when I attack some village.. Sometimes it says reload game or connection lost... üò¢ I already got three stars but when I reload it... I didn't get anything.. even just a little lot.... Ahahahah,5
"I purchased a gold pass but It is take so long to receive into my account...It makes me disappointed so I change my 5 stars to 1 star. It's always happen when I purchase something in Clash of clans , it's always delayed to receive.Plsss..fix that.",4
"I have been playing this game for years and its still as good as i remember. If the developers can add a feature for clan members to see who's online and who isn't it would help a lot to build and improve a clan. Overall, this ia a really good game.",5
"I like the game ive been playing for almost 2 months now.But my problem is what is the point of the revenge button if i cant attack someone i want to.I would be happy if you could do something about it like maybe we could attack the person even if he/she has guard,shield Please really do something about this",4
"Everything is perfect in this game but only one update need to done by developer is ""the game graphics should be on 3D mode"". If I could see the other side of my village then it will be like my whole life completeüòä",5
"everything was perfect before this update.... i apologise for giving 2 stars but supercell deserve this you know why i am saying that-my problems according to a bug .....i was contacted in customer support through in game the bug is-when i am trying to close the clan capital tab suddenly after click on it,game crashes....its happening every time",2
"I really like clash of clans. It warms my heart to go to my village and see the wizards fire, the goblins gold, the balloons in the air and golems on the ground. I am in love with clash of clans. You can use troops to attack other bases which is really fun. Supercell makes really good games. My favorite part about this app is that they included colored people (the hog rider) in the game to support black lives. I also think it's a beautiful thing that they put LGBTQIA+ troops in the game.",5
It is a good game but the developers should really consider shortening the time it takes for us to upgrade buildings. It took me 16 days to upgrade to townhall 14!!,4
"I am using Samsung A10 android, and since my last phone update, the app always crash whenever I try to open it. Haven't played this past months. Now on their latest update, it works on my phone again & I am more than happy to be back.",5
"Wow, came back after 8 years and found a lot of upgrades and cool troops. Graphics of the game has been definately improved.",4
"Updates make it impossible to reopen and play. A nightmare between supercell and google play, you cant keep both villages on the same platform and 'instructions' suck. ZERO help from customer service.",1
"Great game, I love older games like this, I didn't have this game when I was younger but I still feel nostalgic. You don't have to if you don't want to but I think it would be cool if you made it so you can name heros. Maybe for 100000 gold or a couple thousand dark elixer, or maybe a 100 gems? For example, I think the barbarian king looks like a Bob so I wanna name him bob. Credit: me",5
The game is great! But the game is always crashing it's ruining my attack in capital raid and I attack in multiplayer and it suddenly crashed I lost 21 trophies for that,4
"Im not the one to usually rate games, but it would be wrong not to rate this amazing game! It's so fun and a good way to play with friends. Honestly, just get the game and if you don't like it uninstall it you have to try this game!",5
"It would be a great game if I did not have to restart the app every time I open it because it crashes during loading. The game was crashing before the latest update and still does crash after the most recent update. It is also annoying to have messages always poping up to ask things like to rate the game even though I already rated it. Lastly, with the new update it seems that some notifications go missing. This is my updated review and I can still only rate 2 stars for all the inconveniences.",2
"Its been 7 years and i love this game. But this last update irritated me because the game isn't getting loaded. Even i tried installing it again but then also it just shows-""Good news, new update available"". Please get it fixed.",4
It's a good game. Why are there so many maintenance breaks? And if you need that many please give atleast an hour warning/notification. An hour is usually the time duration for boosts. I have lost so much time of the boost because I started a boost and 10 minutes later a maintenance break of 1+ hrs. The time does not pause and the boosts go to waste in the background.,4
"Great game, terrible company. Clash of clans is a good game, I have played for over 6 years. The one star review is for supercell and their customer service. As a clan we were in round 6 of cwl, when suddenly the clan just got shut down, no explanation, no warnings, nothing from supercell. We have tried to get an explanation from supercell as to why this happened but have had no response.",1
"Not working after new update properly. You go to attack someone and it closes out. I got a error to clear my cache because of a bug it said, and I do it and it's still not working. Doing it again now after another update.",3
"AMAZING, this game is fun and addictive. I play it once a day for the last 5 years or so. DO NOT AT ALL play the stupid copy cat games that are obviously based on this game. It will always be the original and it is one of my favorite handheld games by heart ‚ù§Ô∏è.",5
Some suggestions: Free Capital Gold should be continuosly generated like a gem mine and not require a login exactly after 24hrs to collect and reset it. Exchanging resources to generate capital gold is fine but adding a 3 day builder time is something which most players would avoid. Having just a forge time of 3 days without involving home base(5+1) builders seems as a better option.,4
"Grinding and pay to win/progress. As long as you do not take it seriously and competitive can be relaxed fun. Secondary village can be competitive, but the point they do not allow transfer of currency to main village or conversion to gems once you have maxed all is annoying. 2022 - Finally sound can be lowered asking for this for years...",3
"This game is outstanding I've just downloaded the game 2 weeks ago and already making progress,the game is competitive between players and in clan wars,this game gives a highly recommended playable strategy game of war.The game ideal many features which is very cool,the game isn't that boring and it's worth downloading..",5
"This game is going 3rd class day by day because of bugs and crashes.... whenever i start game it gets error of unstable connection,first i thought my internet is having some issues but now i am confirmed that this game is having some issues, because of this error i loose every game",1
"It's a solid ""okay"" game. The beginning phases are more interesting because of the low build/upgrade times while the later stages of the game are a test of patience and commitment. Pros are that the game is generally fun and interesting. It's one of the best made versions of these types of games and has withstood the test of time to prove it. Cons are mainly the matchmaking and slowdown in ""late"" game. You're put against players of differing levels and it takes a LOT of dedication over time.",3
"As you reach higher townhall lvls, at 11 or 12, the game becomes so stagnant, every upgrade takes 6-7 days even for basic updates, its almost non-playable at higher THs. The devs sucks at making some changes",1
"It becomes boring in every update.. Adding new new village. Even its hard to play one village. It becomes three now. Home village , bulider village, now districts village. Boring. No time to maintain three village infact no time to play three in one games. One is also more than enough .instead of adding more villages its better to add townhall in home village. Eg currently the downhall is upto 14 so u can upgrade the downhall to 15, 16 like that. But adding more villages it is so tired. I quit",1
"Good game. The only problems are sometimes when I go to my builder village, all of the sprites are just black blobs. Other than that, this game is super fun and I would reccomend it.",4
This game was so exciting for me to play since i love strategies game so much. Its easy to understands. And we need a lot of patience in this game since every upgrade sometimes need 2 weeks to finish.,5
"Its a very good game, it test your strategy to build your best defence in your base. Not only in your defence, in your attack's too,How would you place this character to defeat the defense of your enemy, how would you place this spell. It test your patience tough but its all worth it.",5
"The game is really good and I only have one complaint: exponentially increasing upgrade times, I see no reason for upgrades to take several days, otherwise it's a great game",4
It is the best game I had ever played. My device is so low that somtimes even play store or youtube are aslo hanged on it but coc does not hanged a single time. This is a great game for low devices. I had not faced a single bug yet. Please bring the global chat back.,5
"Great game, it is a very fun online strategy based game, and it is extremely fun to build your ultimate base. If you like online strategy games then download now. You can easelly get lost in it.",5
Keeps logging me out. Cant use app on two devices. Have to request new supercel id too often. Supercell almost impossible to contact for support. Thinking of giving up playing after 2 yrs,1
I have nothing to say about graphic or anything.! The Only Thing I've Got mad is this update is in wrong timing!!!!! And there's no button for update later!!!!! I mean my location has the worsts data connection! Can you please put a button for update later. ?!,3
User experience is great. Good graphics. Please reduce upgrade time for research I seen some upgrades are going beyond ten days ..seeing such huge time will loose interest to play...,4
Battle results are pre decided and it all depends on dev who will win .no matter what you do troops will go where they wish to cause you lose . Troops targetting is pointless also for old players upgrade time is enough to stop them from playing,1
"It's a really fun game when you know what to do, the characters are amazing and if your a clash royale fan and play game and the you down load clash of clans your going to have some much fun, and it's a rpg game and you get to up grade your stuff and get elixir and coins so you can up grade the town that make it more easy to use when you get up to level 4 town you will be able to go to a hole nether village you have to take care of that island and there are new characters like rage barbarian",5
"Please do not add more and more village to take care of because it becomes boring and tiring. You should focus on the graphics more or make it more interesting. Why not focus on main village strategy, not on adding something new and it's not really good and catchy.",1
"Why keeps on logging out.now its hard to play...its frustrating...i keep doing uninstalling it and download thinking somehow could be fix..but its useless.why? b4 i think its my network cgnal,but when i play Call of Duty and Mobile Legend,network signal is good.no lags no buffer.",2
"Good strategic game but very unfair when you get mismatched in clan war, Supercell please fix this thing or create a filter where you can select the amount of town hall levels each clan can have in war like each clan can only have 5 th14, 10 th13 and 15 th12s so that it becomes a fairer war. It is fine if it is a town hall above you but when u have to attack a max th14 as a th12 or as a th11 things get a bit more tricky, it is more than just unfair.",4
"This game is so old, and throughout its time it has continued to be the best mobile game you will see on the app store. However the AI in the builder base is a bit dodgy at the moment. Troops will go around a wall to attack the farthest away defence, probably because it was closest to them on the outside of the wall, but they end up going through several defences and being expended because of it.",5
It's a great game. There are no flaws or glitches. It may be a little pay to proceed type sometimes ü§£but all in all it's a great and intriguing game.,5
"Best strategy game as always, the latest maintenance inbound fixed the app crash, very hopefully we are enjoying and clashing with double excitement. Efforts of support team once again wholeheartedly appreciated. Thank youüòäüôè‚ù§",5
"It was great until the last update. Why don't you separate the latest update with another name? Why you guys adding other games in one game? Because your new game won't last long? Thay why you're adding different types o games in one? Don't you think it is effects on resulation? I'm a legend player from today I'm gonna uninstall the ""Clash of Clans"". All the best Supercell",1
"I don't understand why the forge takes builders to craft loot. Most players have all builders working for the main base and would rather not craft more capital gold. Capital gold should be more of an active grind like walls with a loot converter with no builder requirement or waiting time. The forge loot crafting is just a massive scam and only makes things harder which boots people off the game more. Clash of clans is strategy, but it gets to a point like now when it is ridiculous.",2
"Pretty good game, but its getting hard to raid someone because your losing resources,the building getting expensive to upgrade and upgrading troop its expensive and take a while.",3
Great Game overall I see lots of reviews saying that the upgrades take forever once you get more advanced I agree with that fact that they take long but not the fact that it sucks the fun out of it. As I said before great game overall and there isn't really anything I don't like about the game so 5 stars :D,4
"It's still one of the best f2p games, no need to get packages with $$$ to be competitive, just a little more patience. It definitely values your skills in attack rather than your skills in spending. That said..since they removed global chat recruiting got so hard that it slowly killing many clans.I wish supercell could revise the recruiting options, the tags are not doing that well. Overall amazing game that c a n stick in your phone/tablet for years",5
"A fantastic strategic game.got hooked since a friend introduced it to meüëäüôè For beginners,pls upgrade each item,spell and weapons before upgrading your hall further..do not rush. Also more friendly challenges improves your strategy..Join a clan nowüëäüòé",5
"This is my favourite game, I started playing this since 2011 until now but I hope the upgrading of all the buildings are not too long to wait to finish. Can u please finish faster the upgrading of all buildingsüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè",5
"I love this game so very much, I have been playing it for years but I think it needs more. I think there needs to be more heros and pets and add another lvl to the builder base.",5
"I've been playing this game for 6 years, The social aspect of the game is what I mostly play for; the new troops and game modes implemented add a welcome change to the usual train and raid gameplay.",4
I give this game a 5 star ofc but the reason is if i build a building and than suddenly at the same time I want to cancel it it takes 50 percent of my loot! this thing happens in specialy builder base this is not fair I literally started building that building a second ago plz supercell if this a bug fix this or whatever this is I'm playing this game since 2017 and at that moment the game was truly amazing and my favorite game of all time,3
It is a op game. It's very challenging it's the best for me. But it some times shows some funny glitches like p.e.k.k.a running the whole village after a butterfly üòÇ,5
Best strategy game ever. All the new updates just make the game more fun to play. You dont even have to spend money to max out your base!! It doesnt take that much longer to progress without money. I am completely addicted,5
"Used to LOVE HAVING AND PLAYING THIS GAME but now that the upgrades keep coming one after the other, when I try to play it shuts off my phone. It doesn't even get to the ¬≥/4 mark to load the game before it's freezing and then shutting down. I haven't been able to play in two months.",1
"I love COC, it's long... Well it's neverending because of the frequent updates. It's a must have on your device. Throughout my early life I've played this since it came out, it's been a bumpy road but now it's *chef's kiss* wonderful. 11 out if 10 people who played COC would recommend.",5
"This game is a good game but some of it is pay to win, and the attacking system is mostly good but you can get lower town halls or way higher town halls to attack, but i think that you should be able to just attack your own townhall level to just make it fair.",4
"I love this game, always have, and when the clan capital update came out I was super excited, but it wouldn't update, I tried reopening the appstore, restarting my phone and even uninstalling and reinstalling, now the game itself won't update Edit:for anyone else experiencing this problem just clear yours Google play data",2
"Game crashes, literally was happening a year ago thought it was a bug, thought it'd be fix, but its not, I can't start the game it crashes while loading everytime, thought it was my internet but even while using wifi it doesn't want to load in",1
"I've put to many hours in this game to give it anything less than 5 stars. The game is very addictive and very satisfying to play; the animations are smooth and everything is nice. So yeah, for a mobile game not half bad.",5
This game is one of the best when it comes to strategy games and its full of monthly updates like the gold pass and much more. I highly recommend this game if your looking to strategies. Other than that see u in the leagues,5
"I've been playing for years without a problem, Now I'm having a problem. When I start the game, it loads up but when I get to a little over the half way mark of loading, it kicks me out of the app. Please help",2
"best game ever I played. This game excites me more I play. I am playing COC for more than 8 years. This is opest game I ever had in my life. SUPERCELL all games are super awesome. I also play Clash Royale (CR) that is alos just awesome keep making strategy games in future. This game is more adventerous than reality, more addicting it sounds and the best!! I have a millions of words to say about this game.... This has been a huge part of my life....",5
Been at this game since day one. Probably the best game out there. Not much to say about it. Can't say nothing bad about the game. Keep it up. Our clan is probably got some the best in the game we are a bunch of guys who have been on this game since clash first came out. Can't wait for more updates n hopefully new levels up.,5
"Great strategy game and addictive. Slow progress unless you spend real money though, waiting whilst things get built, as you only get 2 free builders (so maybe have 2 games on the go to fill waiting times). TIP save your gems for another builder! It took me time to learn the best things to do first as i'm not already familiar with this type of game. The battles are fun though, as nothing is actually destroyed, and you don't seem to lose much money when it's stolen in battle.",4
"My connection is very slow even i can surf every site I go but in this game. I tried clearing everything and reinstall but the problem still persisting. I cant enjoy playing right now, it sucks so bad that i wanna quit. Any possible solution for this?",1
Cost of buildings and walls is increased after the update and training potion is not working on archer queen in town hall 10 . Still there are many that changed I didn't like them and I don't like the update.,4
We have a leader and 4 co-leaders in active and we can't kicked them. You rotate the leadership but it puts a inactive player as leader. That sucks. This needs fixing. Very poor game design. Why aren't inactive players kicked from a clan automatically. Still waiting for reply.,1
"You guys are so bad at account system. You guys should secure more rather than putting an email. It should have a pass and verification code if someone is playing your account and you can verify ""if this is you"". Lot's of hackers can easily hack an account if this weak account system will continue. Please make sure the account is well secured. Thank you, waiting for a better up comes.",1
"It's good tho, I remembered so many things when I playes coc.... The bonds I had, friends and the nostalgic time when we don't have any problems in life...... Playing coc since 2014 (the only thing I suggest is to lower the color of your game...it makes my eyes hurt)",4
"I would rather not rate anything cause they are using updates to take our money. I have updated once already it didn't work,it was still saying there is an update on the game..i kept trying it.the download will just finish and keep starting again...me I can't be wasting data on rubbish...üòêüòê....and ev3n though there is an update, still let the game function properly....until it is out of date....üòêüòêüòêüòí.",1
Good game. The difference between the gameplay when spending money and not spending money is alot different which most likely can't be helped but it's 100% more fun when u spend money cuz It doesn't take years to progress. You should be able to upgrade the builders cuz upgrade time take literally days. That might be how you the developers want it but waiting real time for an in game upgrade isn't fun.,4
I admit that you will really enjoying playing this game ...it's an awesome game you could play...but I am bit disappointed with the sound effects in this new update especially the sound in versus battle and the sound of the spell in the multiplayer battles,4
"We have a CWL going on and I can't login after this update. Whenever I login, it say... ""a new version of the game is available"" instead of logging in. Its a one star until the issue is fixed.",1
Great...pay per play is getting ridiculously expensive...Legend League forces you to fight the battles but doesn't let you pick the opponent it randomly selects way way way to difficult opponents then forces you to wait over 15 hrs. before you can battle again...RIDICULOUS...please patch update ASAP...try and keep it FAIR for everyone who plays this app.,5
"One of the few games online that you can play, be social globally, and play till you max out without spending a penny. They do have some sweet pay for loot packages which will help but if you are not inclined to pay don't. Recommend this game to everyone.",5
"Pathetic support experience, even if I am providing the correct player tag details Its not collecting the account information and it is not going to the Agent level discusion. OTTO stage is very pathetic. I have lost my 8 yrs old game account with max TH because of this nonsense support system. I have to quite this game now",1
"This is a great app and I played this game every day, but the new update have low quality of graphics...thats all..I hope supercell can change it into a high quality graphics again.",5
"I've played since early 2013, had a few breaks over the years but have been back playing daily for 3 years now. Honestly a very good mobile game. Always tweaks to balance to keep the game competitive and interesting. New content and QoL updates help massively. Definitely not a pay to win game and requires patience and perseverance. If you choose to buy the Gold Pass it's a very cheap price each month and honestly has great value compred to most mobile games.",5
"I've downloaded this game twice. First time I gave up when my friends started a clan and abandoned it immediately. It's not bad. But the matchmaking is atrocious and unbalanced. I either match with players two or three levels higher or lower. 70/30 seems to be the ratio. My attacks are fine until I get 3 starred on defense. Lazy lightning/dragon attacks are the norm. Not to mention the A.I. borders on idiotic sometimes. Overall, it's okay. Matchmaking is the big thing.",3
"This game has many things right that other games don't have. Keep up the good work. You've added new things without changing the core of the game. Eg. Having the home Base, then the builder Base and now the clan capital :)",5
"Great and always bri.gs with it fond memoties of being hardstuck in gold, i love the grind the game can bring. Supercell always manages to bring interesting updates as well as amazing challenge bases to keep the interest of their players!",5
"Exciting game,great graphics,addictive also,but whenever I start searching players in multi-player battle it cames at connection error (first),a few days ago I claimed gold but it did,nt come into my storage I ignored but tomorrow it was repeated (second),when any player attacked on my base the trophies are reduced but more than it was showing in my battle log(third)there are many more excuses but after all it is a great game so supercell it is very amazing creation but you have to maintain it .",4
"Is it just me, or is the update requiring alot more data than usual? Since it buffers for a few minutes everytime I Login/Switch Accountsü§î.. Anywayy.. the Clan Capital is Amazing!! Hoping to see you add a ""Remove Obstacles"" Option in the Clan Capital Edit Mode",3
Lovely game ever !!! This game can increase our players IQ level because this game needs strategies and most important thing brain. Everyone plays COC but according to me only 2% are quite good. This game gives you best battlefield game experience. Thanks to SUPERRCELL for create this unique and wonderful game .,5
"Game would be great without supercell ID, tried to get my account back and they ban'd me for phishing twice now after giving them the right information. I miss the old sign in and ways to get your account backed up. I hope the sorry excuse for employees get fired. Thanks for the help supercell ID for effing me and making me lose my account from highschool 7 years ago so thank you supercell. I have really tried and they don't even give me a chance worst service and company ever and lose of money",1
It is a very good game .Many plans ans strategy needs to play this game. It has a very good graphics. But the upgrade timer disturb players...So i give it 4 stars,5
"Game needs major updates on its matchmaking, how long it takes to find a game, can't be bothered to sit and press a button for hours just to find an attack. Also needs to fix it's stingy loot system, what's the point in playing the game when you can't do anything, or you can only play it once a day because it takes hours to train troops.",5
"Listen supercell if you see this, i love this game i am new to it but i love all the world building and leveling up... but there is one glaring issue and i will have to have a complaint about it like others. PLEASE FIX THIS BUG it doesn't allow me to enter the game some times without crashing! And sometimes it takes 6 TRIES to just log in so please fix it so i can love the game even more... 4 stars",4
"V 14.426.1. I love the new update. As a leader, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I really like the ability to see players' 'last online'. But may I suggest to add the ability to dm players? In my point of view, it'll definitely improve players' communication. Overall, it deserve a 5 stars from me. A very good strategy game and suitable for long-term players. It can be repetitive at some point but I think that's normal when it comes to video games. Highly recommend this game.",5
"I would love to be able to donate not just troops but gold, elixir and gems. I don't really give a review for any game, but I see this as important. It is a suggestion that I think should be looked into. I do not know how long it may take Supercell to fix this issue, but it will go a long way in the players helping each other.",4
The game is awesome . But the game is creating a problem after clan capital update. Sometime the game is stucking Black screen while playing war or clan raid. I hope you will understand the problem.,5
It‚Äôs a good games. My first childhood online games. I really enjoy them when i play this games. But they is a problem. The problem is update problem. When your th13 or th14 every update so long like 16/18 days. Otherwise that is a good games.,4
"I'm furious üò°üò°üò° because of connection lost issue, from last 4-5 weeks connection is getting lost in the middle of an attack. I have an excellent network connectivity and getting this issue only in coc. Please fix it",1
"Most of us get bored when playing this game because nothing can we do when we are reach the max TH lv. Or if our TH lv still low that means we just bored waiting an upgrade times that need more than 1d. Or we are just mad bcs losing our Thropy. All we need about this game is somethings that make us more addict and love to this game, like; events, updates, daily rewards, etc. Overall This Game Is PERFECT. (**And btw sorey if my spell was little bit weird, bcs I still practicing my english**)",5
"my experience is so outstanding in coc.. Of course it's a great game to play and little addictive.. You can download it and play.. All fixes are good, nothing any bad occurs in this game. Also after update lots of change had been done.. You should play this and download rate should be reached to 1000 million.. Great job supercell team..",5
"this game has a bug, very boring.. not good. because Builder Hero he go first attack the crusher but it so far of him, the other building that has near to him he ignores it, while the recommended target of him is any? it's crazy men! noob game..! now its better to delete this game app .",1
"It takes more time to be updated. Sometimes it feels very annoying. This game will be better if its update time is reduced. After all, The time to update this game should be reduced from everything.",1
"Hi .. i can't connect my account after i deleted the game .. it connected with supercell . but after i reinstalling the game and when i connected the account,the system said they sent the code to the connected email. But no code comes to my mail. Is that error or something?? Reply to me pls",3
Great strategy game. makes you think like chess. Learning the movement and strength of your builts. You will love to play it everyday. See you in the battles.,5
I am playing coc since 2017 but this type of problem never happen in this game but now after new update the game is lagging and slowing down the mobile phone my friend are also facing the same situation please fix this problem. Game is crashing my phone and slowing down the mobile after new update screen becomes totally black sometimes. not a good sign to have this game in mobile phone.,1
"I wanted to give a feedback regarding SUPERCELL ID. If I want to shift my game progress to another the SUPERCELL ID, I can't do that. I have to stick to the SUPERCELL ID once I logged into that. I want to change the e-mail address of the SUPERCELL ID but don't want to lost the game progress.",4
"I have a HP Chromebook x360. The game used to run on it. After an update the game no longer runs. I have uninstalled and re-installed it numerous times. Updated it when new releases have come out. Still get the same result. Tap on the game icon, the screen goes blank, and then nothing. I'm back to my wallpaper with no Clash of Clans running. I've sent numerous emails to their support email address with no response at all. I've given up the game since it will not run on my Chromebook.",1
"Absolutely fantastic game? This is awesome and challenging game the only problem is when im attacking and when the game disconnect i can't go back to my attack and im always losing so many trophies, idk how you all gonna do something about that problem but if you all can do something about this its gonns be the best mobile game ever because the graphics are all good its a 3d in 2d invironment and theres no lag at all and new troops are very exciting and other than that no problems at all :)",4
The new update is not bad but why'd developers changes lightning sound and the cc troops when ur base is under attack is like training troops when its done and the skeleton traps when they died is same voice as barbarian troops? Really? And specialy eagle artillery sounds in new update is just like a mortar why did you developers do that? That's so lame im a fan of coc since 2018 and I've been playing coc for 4 years and suddenly the new update comes and it's not good as the old one's.,1
"I'm playing clash of clans for 7 years, and it's the first game I've never had a bad feel about it. build, battle, finding friends and group to have fun together. also Whit lots of update that make new features for this game.",5
Why do you guys always make the game force an update that doesn't show up on Google Play for HOURS after the maintenance is done?????? And it's doing it again today... won't let me play without an update but no update is shown on Google play! You should post the updates at the same time you start the maintenance or even 5 mins before,3
It's one of the best games I have played and I really love the game design and the game characters. I would say you should try it once before stating your opinions im sure you will love it after you start to play more often.,4
"Sorry I'm not good at English, but the game is amazing the graphics ,sound effects and gameplay everything is amazing , keep up the good work devs.",5
I really really love this game it's so addicting and so awesome üëçüòé but one thing is that I wish you can use more builders to upgrade a building what I mean is when your upgrading your eagle artillery you have only one builder upgrading it I wish that you can use more builders instead of 1builder upgrading it,4
"Update, tried loading the game and it says update available, try updating it doesn't work. Now can't get to play at all. Love this game but suddenly no longer works on my phone üò≠ continually gives error message saying its not responding. Can you resolve this issue?",4
The issues i have with this game is when i log back in sometimes it has bought pack for me without me agreeing the forst time was for extra builder so i didnt mind but now it did it again which is annoying this is the only game where it does that,3
Its fun to play . But this new update is making me sick . My apps keep on crashing in the middle of my game. Its very annoying . My attack was interrupted. Always . Hope to fix this soon .,3
"The trophy system is jacked. On 2 occasions, I have lost over 40 trophies. The most i have been able to gain is around 28 to 30. I do not understand this.",3
"Good game, haven't seen a single ad. I love how there is even stuff do while upgrades are waiting, like attacking someone or versus battles. Only problems is that when you progress, upgrades take longer and longer. Even some of them take days. I also wish singleplayer mode was actually online.",4
This Games is great play well. I played the game before 12 year and still now . I like it.But I don't like something wrong in this game.That is very long time defense update timer and then very long time hero update that's I don't like. Everything is fine only that update timing .,5
I am not happy with the latest update as i am unable to play my game. Whenever I open my game it starts showing buffering sign even if I have good internet connection. Please resolve this bug asap Because I am playing this from last 5years and never experienced this issue.,3
"I used to play this game. But for the longest of time, there ain't no significant improvements at all. The time spent training troops, upgrading structures and even upgrading skills are still annoying. This game is no better than State of Survival which is, by far, one of the most intellectually conceptualized game you can find here in PlayStore. You might want to check it out. Clash of Clans is dead!!! Too old and not so innovative at all. üò≠ü§Æü§¢üëéüí©",1
"The clan capital is a really fun add on to the game. After all these years you still have a great time playing. It's arguably a better time to start playing now than some time ago with how active most clans are, and the opportunity to grow shows quickly.",5
"Played for the nostalgia and it's better than I remember! Only complaint is that the upgrades take just a bit too long, but that just makes it a fun challenge",5
Always come back to this game. It's always improving and fun at all levels. Wish an update could reduce build times at higher town halls.,5
Sometimes in the middle of the game notification pop up and said ' newer version is available on play store please update your game' and reload the game automatically . But there are nothing in play Store.This is very annoying when you got a dead base with 1 million gold) elixir . Please fix this .üôç,4
Solid strategy game that isn't over top in content nor does it demand pay to win. The season passes are bad but I've been playing since the game came out and haven't spent a penny. Almost max townhall 12,5
"U know it's too messy nowüòë And i can't keep up it's too hard for me to countinue playing this freaking awesome game anymore, btw i love this game but the thing is that i can't keep up with all the daily updates,event, and clan stuffs .... So i quite but tbh i loved this game a lot love ya‚ò∫Ô∏è. And thank you Btw i have too many acc and 2 heavy clans with loads of nice players just like me",5
"Excellent game! some of the upgrades and added battles and places can get confusing if you don't stay active for, me anyhow.",5
I'm just tired of trying to recover my account iam playing Coc since 2014 or 15 but when i try to login again into the game it shows me to login with supercell I'd but I didn't connect my account with supercell I have all the details like on which email it is created but still i can't access my account and every time I try to contact supercell they don't help me at all even I send a email but still there is no reply only bot will reply you . I think supercell didn't care about it's user at all.,1
Nice strategy game of supercell. A game from which many things can be experienced. How a village is built. Keep you things up to date of all defenses army especially the resources and townhall.,5
My personal favourite game Reading what I written makes me quite sad as I acedently lost my 2 accounts which I spent like ¬£250+ on witch is a lot for me üò• would still recommend the game as it is amazing but I don't think I can replay it after spending years playing it and it just being lost like that,5
Please reback the old sound effects the old sound effects is very attractive and enjoyable. But the new sound effects is very worst I'm very disappointed with super cell team.,3
"Game is awesome but before some year a update which is coming very bad . The update is removing ""Globe Chat"" which is very helpful to invite player easily by conversation but now there is no ""GLOBLE CHAT"" . And it is very tough to build new clan we cannot convinced to player stay our clan without conversation. Please do something.",1
"May 2nd, 2022. Says there is an update, I click on update, takes me to Supercell to install, BUT ONLY OPTION IS PLAY. I hit PLAY, and right back to the update. Now in a loop with no way to install or play. I tried to UNINSTALL and REINSTALL, issue did not clear. HELP!",5
I love this gave I been playing it for so long there is one thing that has been bugging me clan games you only have a hour to collect it and whilst I'm in school I can't collect it what I am asking for is to extend the time to 1 day for players who are busy have more time to collect it I have lost many rewards in clan games because I couldn't collect them in time please supercell fix this problem.,4
"It's a really great game, with great graphics and textures which add to the slick UI of the game. The game design is next level!!!",5
I enjoy playing this game. It is strategic and fun to play. Also most players that I met in the game are non toxic players. Give this game a try if you have time. Because you really need a lot of it to upgrade your assets in the game (lol). Have fun!,5
"Great game, but sometimes when I try to open the game it kicks me to my phone home screen before it finishes loading. Sometimes it will load, then kick me out a few minutes later",4
Good game but the upgrade times after town hall 9 are really taking the piss. They need to reduce the upgrade times otherwise there's not much to do on the game ...,3
this apps I tried to download. then tried to open it. but every time I open these apps it comes back. a few times when he tried to open it but even there he was loading. the loading doesn't end because he returned home or he closed.,1
"This game is really fun but it keeps kicking me out of the game repeatedly. The only problem I've ever had with the game for 5+ years. Please fix this, I wasted two clan raids because of this.",1
It just always kicks me out of the game in the loading screen and I cannot uninstall it and then install it because they removed the feature that saves your progress when you install the game,1
The best thing about the game is that it you wont run out of things to do for a long time. But the negitive aspect is that upgrades take alot of time so I get bored,4
After recent updates this game is crashing while switching accounts or Just open it. It shows black screen and then off again and again this same mistake was happening before please fix this ASAP.,1
"Game sucks, whenever there is an update, it forces you to see what the update is about. Won't let you just play without watching tutorial. This should be optional.",1
"I like this game the most but after the recent update, whenever I opening the game it's show black screen I redownload it but nothing work facing the same. its too much annoying I can't attak in war do something or I m deleting this game",1
"Way too much with the new update. I like the original home village only. I upgrade the builder base only because I have to do so in order to have extra worker / new ugrades in the home village. After a decade of playing, it is time to say goodbye to COC.",1
"I would did just half star , because my game is again and again crashing and not able to open games . I like this game so much I have played before but in this year I am not able to play because of something bad issue game is crushing hope you fix it. I would rated 5 I like the game most because of game is not a I have just one star . Please fix it.",1
This game can be perfect if user allow to control players as well. Sometime things that we use act very stupid. There shoupd be a option to control army and give instructions so we can guide or point our army where to attack.,4
"After I updated the app. I can't open it and encountering auto-close. I've already done many troubleshooting on my phone like reinstalling, clearing the date and cache also restarting my cp but no effect. What seem to be the problem? What should do to fix it?",1
This game is really nice but a few things that i want to can upgrade the house of the builder The tradingpost on the side And that's it üòá keep going (2018) (Small edit. It's 2022 and i still play it. Love it),5
What the hell with the recent update. This is just unnecessary. It was really nice game but the update made it worse. It used to addictive but now I think it's time to uninstall. Seriously there is no need of that capital update.,2
"Today 6-15-2021 the game told me to update. I updated in Play Store. But the game keeps saying ""you need to update"". I cannot start COC to play. FIX THIS BUG! Today 9-27-2021 this same issue is happening again. Fix this!! Today 5-2-2022 it did 5he same thing again! A repetitive ""you need to update loop""",1
"Should have never removed chat out this game. It's pretty boring. Hard to recruit clan members without chat. The recruit member search option sucks. Clan capital update is just another builder base. Attacking clan capital is boring also. Overall, no campaign mode and boring, boring, boring.",2
"After update I've facing some problems like crush issue, slow speed, battery drain and I detected optimization problem. Please optimize this update with care. The game is now lagging every moment. And what you know guys the Supercell team is not read our comments and also they have not time to reply us!!!",2
It was OK until recent update. My android is 5.0 and after updating the game I can't even enter the game. It jumps out at the few seconds. Please fix it. Reinstalling couldn't help.,2
It was the best game I have ever played . But yesterday I have updated it and after that it is not opening in my phone and keeps closing again and again even I have Wifi connection in my home . Kindly solve this issue as soon as possible .,4
"This is really awesome game. I have been playing for a long time now, but there is just one problem with CWL matchmaking system its very unbalanced. But over all its good game and quite addictive too...",4
It's very fun and it's a good challenge the time it takes to build and upgrade things are just a little long and annoying but otherwise it's really good,4
Hey supercell i have a sugeestion. please like you have added the feature on clan home page of showing that when was a player last active. add the same feature to the clan wars page so that we can see which player is active and who to take in war. its so difficult to cross check everyperson on clan page then add him to war. i gave one star just for attention. once supercell reply to me i will again convert it to 5 stars.,1
"This game is dead. Due to playerbase inactivity, clan war matchmaking is unequal, builder base battles are unequal and pointless. They added clan troop donation level limitations, so joining higher level clan has become pointless. Featureless updates and same gameplay (you still have to wait for an eternity to get your army trained and upgrades). I don't even suggest this for 2022 gamers.",1
Extremely dissapointed with the new update. An achievement was there to reach master which is 2600 trophies to get 2000gems. but in the new update it chaged to champion of 3200 trophies. I lost my hope to get 2000 gems.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,2
I love the game it's so fun especially if u in a clan that is active and communicates with each other. Unfortunately after the recent update tho I havent actually been able to update the game I've had to delete and reinstall the game.,5
This is so poor quality after updating. The original sounds of the game's inside things is changed and all operator of the game sound is same . Please take step for this cause. Because this is my favourite game.,5
"Its a good game but i can't update it so it means i can't enyoy the experience every time i try updating, i can't it's not avalable and i tried reinstalling without losing my base but it tiezes me, i uninstall and the update button pops up but it's to late",2
"This is so Awesome! I Started with just nothing, but i grind. Now I'm very Good at it. I love how peoples can Make Clans and now I have New Friends from that Clan. I just enjoyed the game so much, and I even forgot to review and rate it üòÖ. However I Started Playing it 2017 üôÉ, Theres not too much bugs in it. But sometimes when I'm building üôÇ But it's Not a Big Deal, I still Enjoyed it for 6 years of Playing it.. ü§ó QueenTanya is my Username üòÅ.",5
"This is a classic. I've played it for a good 8 years and almost never burned out. It is super satisfying to see this game still improving all the time, can't wait to see the future.",5
I'm currently TH- 8 after playing for less than a month. so far fun game but seems like it's going to take a long time to level or leveling might need money to speed the process up.,4
After previous update clash of clans would not load so I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and it loaded on about the 5th try I made a couple moves and the screen went black then it would not load again so then I tried the same uninstall and reinstall it loaded on the third try and I was at the very freaking beginning I have spent years getting to where I was if you think I'm going to start at the beginning not in a million years piss on you clash of clans,1
"Played it since i was a kid love it takes time do not play if impatient it is a long timed game not pay to play it would make you a easy target talk to a person bout it, or else this game ive played for like a wile like when i was 8 so7 year later i have a desent base fyi DO NOT UPGRADE the town hall fast you will regret it just upgrade the defence first made my mistakes... ONLY FOR THE PATIENT VERY PATIENTor else be free to download:D",5
"This used to be a really fun game, but ever since the recent update, my base doesn't load when I switch supercell ID accounts or try to switch from multiplayer base to versus base.",2
"I have had my ups and downs with this game but I have returned to my old clan and I am leader again. I have started to have fun with the game again and if this update that is coming is as good as it sounds then I will give it a 5/5. I have played this game an unhealthy amount of time, I'm talking thousands of hours but it is still fun. Best mobile game of all time! I love the new hero change!!!!",4
The best game I've ever played but for some reason the loading screen that says downloading content just doesn't download whatever it's going to download and instead it says try again either my phone sucks or there's something wrong with the loading screen,5
"Just a really cool game, good variety, constant refreshing, keeping interest (or addiction) going. Builder base has been maxed for 3+ years, almost pointless until the clan games",4
"Supercell, I have lost my id as I opted out of supercell id to change it's gmail and login with a new one, the previous iCloud which I used to register for supercell id is no longer with me so i couldn't do anything so i had to opt out of supercell id and when I tried to join supercell id with a new gmail, I can't find my village or my account. Please help and one more thing the game keeps crashing recently after clan capital update it has increased so much that i literally can't even open it.",3
"I recommend it .. but keep in mind ... it's a ""time consuming game"" but in the end , well worth it . 4-5 years strong . üòé 2022 may 5th . Still at it. Wish I knew how long I've been playing . Game great. Clan up . Build together. Worth it.",5
"Very long waiting time to upgrade and heroes long time to heal. Buildings on upgrade should still be functioning at its present level, ex. Spell factory",3
This game is awesome because it's like a mind game where we need to make our base in such a way that enemy gets difficult to destroy our base and also we need a good trick to attack other base and I have been playing coc for more than 5 yrs and at first coc had only till max th10 but now it had upgraded to th14 max and hope to see u far enough in future and this game is soo good .. Thankyou supercell for making such like this game,5
"After latest update I cannot open the app. I get stuck in a loop. Update available. Install, press play. Update available...... Th√¨a is not the first time updates don't work. Annoying.",1
"I love you supercell for this update! New clan capital that will helps me for forging my excess resources, buying items on traders which can help me to easily get the 6th builder for buying bb resources, self donating specifically the super troops and sieges. And most importantly, IT'S NOW COMPATIBLE ON MY VIVO PHONE (Vivo Y91C)! YESSS! Before the update, I need to open it a hundred times and its still crash on loading screen. But now I can open it anytime! üòò I love youuuu! Thank youuuu üòá",5
It's good game but you not get base according to ur level u get according to you trophy and I am in Titan 1st and my base is th 11 rush I am in 112 level but I have to attack on th 12 and they are almost nearly 200 level and I get almost 15 trophy as a average in attack and in defence i lost almost about 30 trophy fix that thanking you,5
"I've been playing this for ages, but no review so: Epic game I definitely recommend really fun with friends if you create a clan, it just join one. But yes extremely fun and hard to get good in the game, which is god in my opinion so when you upgrade to town hall level 11 like me it's rewarding.",5
The game too good.Good gaming graphics and good strategic playing. I am playing this game since 2015 and now I am at th10 but after the update of clan capital the game keeps stopping in my 'Moto g5s plus'.My humble request is to please fix this bug then I will give it 5 stars. Thank you.,4
"Truly a great game and flawless except for one area. Upgrade time for heroes are absurd to the point where you pretty much cant use your heroes because 95% of the time, they are upgrading. And if you dont upgrade your heroes, you will be behind in progress. Dark elixers are already hard to get. Please add another feature such that we can work to get our upgrade times for heroes reduced drasticallly because heroes are very important for our attacks!",4
"I can't play it anymore. Since the last update, the game is crashed/force close whenever I want to play it. It even didn't open the loading screen",1
One of the worst game ever I see Too much net and ping problem without any reason . I tested this problem In data and wifi but nothing in change . After update the latest version the ping problem giving me pain too much fix this,1
Fun overall game. Could be better with progress and keeping people entertained as the game gets into higher town Halls. Loose a lot of people because gets boring as the game slows down.,3
I stopped playing this game over 5 years. I restarted quite recently it is still one of the best game. It gives imoprtance to players not money giving good events new skins etc. This game is far better than some games which is almost 2gb and not giving a s**t to the players (pes 2022),5
Should have rated 20 star if I had to...‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•üî•üî• This is a very fun and addictive game..! Unlike others...this is still the best strategy game I have ever seen!!‚ô•Ô∏èüî•üî• The game is worth spending real money on....without regrets! The only thing is....if you are IMPATIENT DO NOT PLAY cos you won't enjoy... though am impatient too but...I still enjoy it anyway ‚ô•Ô∏èüî•üòÖ üíØ üåü to you guys!! Pls keep it up...,5
This new update bring too much bugs. My war base defences automatically changes its direction than the original base & its cwl time. Plz kindly fix this bug as soon as possible.,4
"Honestly, this is probably one of my most favourite games along the years. I have created several accounts and I've been playing for 7 or 8 years already and I'm still not bored, the game has a lot of content which makes it really fun to play. The fact that you need to plan and have strategies makes it an immersive game and it is suitable for people with a brain unlike other games where you need to spam. Overall, 5 star rating and I'm looking forward to new content.",5
Its a good game but a few things I think CoC must think about that! 1st the update TIMES are high... And 2nd the costs r high too... Coc may reduce the costs and time of updating... These two flaws may reduce the game playing...n also a bad impact on COC... Thanks!,1
Every thing is good in this game. It is really very nice game but I am giving it 3 stars only because there is no global chat. Global chat was an integral part of this game and without it is gonna be very boring. Please bring it back again. We are unable to grow our clan and I am beginning to lose interest in it.,3
"Everything is great ! But the time to upgrade buildings and troops is very much high , so i request supercell to reduce the upgrade timings",4
"After took many follow-up for builder base village, sad to said it's boring game and after updated new version, it's too boring, didn't understand exactly how much diamon required. As I saw, for anything 02.k or 3.k ot 5.k or 200.k is always ok to upgrade anything in anywhere which is stupid things. Now the game is too much boring after your too much unwanted things. Your team should be thing about builder hall next update. Thank you",1
I think this game would be better if you can watch videos to get gems on this game because it just makes it harder when you don't but yeah it's a good game after all it sure does take long it be cool if you can watcha video to lower time on the building stuff but never ran into a add that's dope,4
Well i have been playing the game for a few years but went off the game for a few more due to updating and was unable to play lost 1 of my accounts as i couldn't remember the password or the email i used just remember that i sended a friend request to my main to remember where to find it as i attempt to recover the account got ban for 31 days as they say it doesn't belong to me its my second account T5 really im on T10 on my main kinda stupid to band for that reason,3
The updates of clash of clans is really good.the new updates and season are fun to play and the game has good graphics (EDIT) The graphics has been completely destroyed in the update of clan capital. Please fix it.,4
U only get opponents that are too low or too high from u. Not enjoyable at all. Sometimes u'll get back to back low bases with low loot. And other times. U'll only get high level bases which u can't defeat at all,1
It is a nice game the graphics are good but can you add this to the game : One builder works on one build why not make all of them work together to make the build faster that is what I think will make it a better game thanks for reading this anyway,5
"So the game isn't that fantastic or anything. And on top of that the service you get from the coc team isn't good at all. I had a th9 , I gave them the name , acc tag , acc lvl , it wasn't in any clan. However they weren't able to give it back. I can see the acc but they said they didn't even found it.",2
It is a fun game and their is no ads that you have to get rid of but you should be careful what you get with your restores because you run out a lot.,5
"I totally recommend this game. If you want adventure you got it. Action? You got it. Tycoon? You got it. Strategy? You got it. And more. And there are no ads. The graphics of this game is amazing and there's so much to do in the game with many areas to explore and expand. In conclusion, I recommend this game 100%.",5
New update available as of 4/21/22. Hit the update button and get redirected to the play store game page. No update available. Only a 'play' button. Press play and game says there is an update available. Vi ious circle and I cannot open the game. Please fix. I am th13.,3
"It takes too long to upgrade stuff. Not a game you can play to kill time because you have to wait 12 + hours, a week, on many upgrades.",4
"One of my first ever game i have played in early 2013, there were many times i didnt logged in for months, hell even almost a year, but i always get back in the game with time. The game can cost a pretty penny, but you can always max out before a new th is out without paying, so that is not a problem (yet)",5
I can't open the game it keeps telling me that there's a new update and it needs to be updated before opening the game so I press the update but on play store there is no other version of this game. please fix this as soon as possible I need to attack on the clan war league.,1
This review is from years ago and I still love this game. Gold pass makes the game much easier which ofc I can't buy. But complicated strategy and attacks keeps it interesting.,5
"Ever since the latest update, I can't play the game because it'll just send me straight to my main menu. I like playing the game and I've been playing for a few months but I need this fixed so my spent money doesn't go to waste.",2
Do something about crashing of the game the game is getting worse and worse with every update looks like they don't care about their people so many people are complaining about it yet they're not doing anything to fix this this is so annoying my device already fulfill all the requirements for this game yet im facing this crash issue supercell doesn't care,1
"1.i lost an account in the past.. 2.i dont like some player because its really rubbish.. 3.i bought the ""ARCHER QUEENS"" skin but i cant get it because this act looks like an online scam so if u ask me to wait for all the challenges to end why is the price of the archer queen skin ""MYR19.90"" on display? It really hurts when the skin i bought using online money transfer is illegal..now i keep playing because i like this game but i have a lot of problems..üòíüòíüòí",1
Please fix my issue regarding on the game that keeps crashing itself. It just takes a few minutes then the game suddenly crashes i hope you resolve this issue.,2
Great game. Love the way you have to do raids to gain resources and how upgrades take time so you don't get the game complete in and hour. Really great new update with the clan capital and keep on with the great work Supercell.,5
"Playing this game since 7 years I never get bored cozz need to use brain while playing wars, have to use strategies in wars and a lot of updates and levels really this is a good game. I love to play games in mobile but this is the only game I never get bored.",5
It was good game.It's attack system and new version of the game also good.But now some glitches enter the game. Recently after this update I can not use my one builder.It was too hard to buy a builder.For this reason I would give you 1 star.Please do something as soon as possible. Then I will give you 5 star.,1
"Current update just trying to put another game into clash. With the huge wait time for upgrading, just feels like a giant time and money sink. No updates for home or bb just basically means no content for max players. Going to be not playing as much until a proper update comes out.",2
I am now frustrated because I am in Th7 and th8 or th9 players are attacking on my base and getting 30 to 35 trophies . And when I attack I am able to finnd only 10 tp 15 trophies. Once I find th8 with 1 trophies soooooo bad matchmaking not good for COC. I hope their team will fix it.,1
"One star! I have been playing coc for 6years then the time you introduced the clan capital there's been a lag thats been happening, sometimes when I attacked then return home the attack that I initiated didn't happen. And the wall is to high to upgrade, seriously? 7m?",1
"so I have been playing the game for awhile now, and just out of the blue I can't login anymore, I bought so many gems, and I cany login, explain that to me or else yall gotta refund me., don't worry it's fixed now it was an Internet issue with most people of the game, the reason I got mad is I'm the leader of a level 15 clan and didn't want to lose members bcs I'm rebuilding the clan. It's good now tho thanks, have fun with the clan capital yall",5
Enjoyable. Game is fun but it takes a long time to upgrade stuff so if you could reduce that time for upgrades then it would be five stars.,4
"This game needs to communicate better with the app store. The game constantly thinks it needs an update, therefore keeping you from playing, but the store doesn't agree and just says 'Play'. Gee, wish I could.",1
I've been playing this since it's release and I'm really enjoying it...my only concern is about the troops..I hope you will modify it so that when after an attack we get to retain the troops that survived..it also helps to reduce the elixir and dark elixir that we have to spend...thank you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,5
"Superb game ,but the time takes in a single upgrade way too much , as well as the wall upgrading cost is way bigger , game devolopers must reduce at least the time , because of the timeyou will loose more players in the future",4
What the heck is going on....im not able to load the game .. Beginning of the loading screen it asks to update the game when i came back to play store there is no option to update except PLAY button. The cycle keeps repeating....what the heck is going on üò°üò°üò°üò°,1
"notice how ur troops are avoiding town halls even if its near. There's no strategy, game is manipulated. SUPERCELL waste of time. good to know more gamers are now aware and switching over to more challenging and fair games.",1
"thank you Clash of clans for the latest update.. after I updated it I can't log in to my account and play Clash of clans.. every time I log in, it always appears ""Login Failed: please try again later"" I tried again and again but nothing change.. please fix it immediately.. thank you",1
"This game is great. My only problem is you should have an update about the clan castle loot. A setting to how many will I withdraw cause if you just put collect all it Collect elixir and gold even thoug I only just want to withraw D.E. and it is also good to put a settings, how many you will withdraw 1000 or more rescources.",4
This game is very fun type of game its really imageine but minor disadvantages in game !! 1st of :-Its so long period time to upgrade like townhall .blue spell etc !,5
"I found a problem, i don't know it's a bug or network, if I use wifi, the connection keep disconnect while I ride the enemy base or do something else. But it won't happen if I use mobile network.",3
Pog a bit. Needs some more builders? Or maybe reduce Time of upgrading things. Make sure when we loose defending attacks the trophies that are reduced as well are also less. Cuz we get 14 and we loose 25+ Still 5 stars rating because my fav :),5
"I am literally not abke to enjoy the update coz of some glitch and many people are facing it. The glitch is , the game is not loading, it automatically closes before the supercell logo pops up and this is very disappointing. Please do something @supercell, I really came with hope.",1
"I can't get into the game, it keeps saying there's an update available but when I go to the play store there isn't. I'm going to uninstall it and reinstall it to see if that helps. It worked!",5
"So, I've played this game for almost 4 years now, and I just started again because my other device broke, but anyway, I still really like this game because of all the new updates, and tweaks, with all the prices being lower, easy to access settings, etc. with my favorite feature having 2 builders on Builder Base, and 6 builders on Home Village, which speeds up progress by alot. (yw for the review)",5
"I enjoy playing it, the longer you play the more I'm having fun. In the beginning it's kinda hard but I'm getting to use of it, learning new techniques and strategies to beat my opponentsü§©",5
Overall Amazing! I've already played this game way back 2015 and I started playing it again this year and i will say a lot have change but good change! I have not experience any error thank god.,5
Clash of clans is a very good game but what I think that should do is add it to pc so more people can play and personally I think it will be a lot better on more platform's . Over all it is a brilliant game and I recommend playing with your friends .,4
"Is it just me that the new update has wrong sound effects in the main village.For example the eagle shot sounds like mortar, the airmine sounds like spring trap and the troops sound interchangeable swap as well as the defenses and traps. Are those are new features or just a bugs?",4
Great game actually addictive but after years of playing it takes forever I've been playing for 2 years maybe even more and my progress is about to be th11 it takes huge strategy and skill I wish you luck on your long journey.üëç,4
Ever since this clan Capital update everytime I open CoC my game looks so blurry. All of my building are low res and my troops look like Pok√©mon sprites. I have to re install the game to get good graphics again. Please fix this bug.,2
This game is very awesome and interesting please download this game and enjoy it...You will have fun because this game has very unique concept and the best thing is that this game is suitable for all age groups. Once again download this game it's free of cost.,5
"The new update (clan capital) is just so awesome! I really love this game, however, the quality & graphics of the game became low that's probably because of the new update but hopefully you could fix it.",5
"I've been playing this game for years now, and it's so addictive! Nice graphics, smooth controls, everything happens the way you want. The only drawback is the ridiculous amount of time taken for a single upgrade at higher townhall levels. Please reduce it!",5
"would you make the baby drags more intelligent?? I mean, with those baby drags go for the buildings that are more far than the buildings that is so close to it. please adjust baby drags I really love using them and its giving me stress in terms of using it.",1
This game has no description. Its awsome. You guys should try it. But i have a small request to supercell after the update the in game sounds have become different it lacks old feeling of clash of clans. You guys should think about it a little.,5
"Been playing olmost since it was released and it's come a long way, Evan thought I've restarted afew times it never gets old. But I do wish the upgrading times were shorter, that doesn't take from my apinion.",5
It already takes forever to upgrade and yet our same builder's have to forge why did u not provide builders for that slows down the whole process that already looks like a life time plus u have to use all our resources to upgrade that darn thing .... still won't spend my money..... all to wicked,1
This is a great game. Good graphics but i hope that we can use 2 or more builders in upgrading one building considering that we have free builders to make the upgrade faster. Thank youüòä,5
Good Game but very addicting and should be played in moderation. Also be prepared to take long breaks from the game if you do not intend to buy emeralds due to the length of time things take in the game.,5
So I did install the new update. But i am facing a problem. My account is connected to google play games. So whenever I open the app and start playing the game the app (game) start consuming net at the speed of 1.2mb/s which in turn will exhaust all my data packs from my internet service provider. This is not showing when you play the game with supercell id. Kindly look into the issue as soon as possible.,3
"Truly one of my top hobbies. I always loved this game and made a lot of people to download it. So much new interesting things that came in after all the updates. SuperCell, what a job well done by creating Clash of Clans!!!",2
very good game as far as graphics and game play but once you get up to about town hall 9 and up you have to wait days to upgrade 1 thing. It makes you not want to play after a while. I have deleted and redownloaded this game 3 timed now. Although the wait timed have gotten much better over the years,4
Hello i want that there must be a option for selecting same members in war..... Because if you have maximum player for war u have to select one by one..... So their must a option to select only previous player for war..... Its save time.... Plzzz update it..,5
"Good quality of life upgrades from past builds that place less emphasis on using gems to upgrade things. However, the game is still extremely unbalanced because of the broken gem play-to-win mechanic and the equally broken matchmaking system. Matchmaking should be based on the level of your town hall, not trophies. You will almost never win a defense because of players who gem their way through the game. Locking some of the games content exclusively behind gems isn't really that great either.",3
"Ever since I was a kid, this game has been talked about, and the fact that as soon as i was able to play it for myself, this game hasn't left my phone ever. great troop balancing, great community building, and systems that function perfectly. The only thing that I can say anything about it long build times in the later townhalls, but that just leads to further base progression rather than flying through the townhalls with underleveled towers. You did stunningly supercell.",5
"Id say its mostly fun for an on and off game but after you get to a certain level upgrades take from 7, 9, 11, and even 14 days to upgrade !crazy! For a free to play it Will take YEARS to get to TH13 let alone 14",4
"I was the active user of this application but after the developer announces the new update , everyone were thinking about something great to come but sadly the new update is so worst even I do not wanna open this game because I was playing the game for 3to4 year and still there is a lot of things to upgrade also in builder base too but now we have to face the new update, what to say now,dear developer do something on troops,spells etc.Thank you,it was really a good time with you, UNINSTALLED ‚úîÔ∏è",1
"Game is just So-so. Fake rts and tower defense. Pairing system is a bit off. Sometimes you get paired with someone two levels above, sometimes below... At higher levels, upgrades will take days/weeks to complete... respawning troops take half hour+ and are used up in battles that last around 2-3 minutes. Basically the more you play, the less Supercell wants you to play.",3
It is an online game. I don't like online games very much because of bundles and Wi-Fi . But it is an amazing game in my eyes. I suggest it but there is this problem where when i update it doesn't but after a million tries it will update. It most of the time i don't know about the other ones .,5
"I feel like we need the ability to attack our own base, it would go a long way to help base builders/designers, would definitely love to have this option",4
"One of my first android games, love it since my childhood and still enjoy it very much. Never feel new to it always filled with nostalgia and new tactics, love to play it, it improved my mental health in my initial years of secondary education. Still my favourite.‚ù§‚ù§",5
Constantly getting Wi-fi bar signal when logging in after the new update sets in. Unable to attack or do pretty much anything else. Pls assist.,1
"Missinformed me about when my haste spell was done, I got a notification that read "" your haste spell has been upgraded to level 5! "" and I hopped on the game all excited, I checked and there was still 5 days left until it got upgraded to level 5, y'all need to stop doing that just so we can hop on the game...smh",1
"Im seeing a lot of hate comments, saying the upgrade times are too long (as th8's btw), game is retarded and some other stuff. The way i see it yall have no patience, and if u played it before 2020 or 2021 came around, then you would know that much reduction was done for upgrade costs and time (plenty of times also). I see no point in complaining as a newcomer to the game; you can't just expect to start the game and finish as a th13 in one year. The game takes time, and i like it the way it is.",5
"There will always a time when I attack, I dont know but my connection lost specially when I attack in Clan War Leagues, but my connection is actually fine. Also sometimes, my screen (magically) turns black while attacking and when it becomes stable again, I already lost. My phone and my connection are doing fine but I guess this is plain unfairness which in this way, they want me to be defeated. But it is still a good game.",2
"Nice, üëç fun to play but please consume the time that is taken by upgrading,building training etc.And when trained troops after battle which troops is safe make it that we don't have to train them in the 2nd battle.isnt a 3d view of village is possible and specially the troop training time is too long please please consume the training time thank you‚ù§Ô∏è",3
"I thoroughly enjoy this game. I have been playing for 5+ years now on multiple devices. No pop up ads, use money or not, great clean game. I would like something more to happen with the builder bases. Mine is completely up graded. The gold and elixir storage is maxed out. Could you make some kind of an update to share the unused gold and elixir with the main base? Just a thought. Still love the game.",5
"The game is really good. Only one problem for me, and that is you only get 5 attacks total for the raid weekend, I would prefer if we got 2 or 3 per clan capital but 5 total all weekend is not really a good start to the update",5
"The update is nice but the fact that we can't raid more than 5 times for the entire weekend is dumb! As a player who was excited that maybe this update would give me something to look forward to since I'm maxed th14 and have nothing to do now .... the attack cap of 5 is a bad addition to this update , if ur clan is inactive you won't go far with 5 attacks. Make the attacks unlimited and lower the gold you receive give us maxed players with nothing to do something to be able to do .....",3
"Really good game. But sometimes the matching system is so unfair. I have level 7 TH and the system always suggesting me to attack level 10 TH. And I have some suggestion, could you guys make a new building like hospital,where it can heal you armies. Because when I destroyed enemies base,the leftover armies just disappear. It would be efficient if you could just heal the armies. Good game tho",4
"Hii, I want to say that this game is fantastic and mind blowing. But there is a suggestion on one feature of super troops. We should be able to cancel the boost of one super troop so that we can go for another troop to boost, there is a limitation of 2 boosting troops only. We have to wait for boosted troop to finish its boost time. Kindly have a look at my suggestion. Thanks",4
I've been trying to contact support from the game for the past couple of days but it still has no response! I tried to email but it just said to contact support from the game. I quit playing this game about four years ago and I want to go back playing clash of clans but it seems the support team won't even reply to me. I might just uninstall this game.,5
"One of the original supercell games, if not the whole ""build your empire"" genre of games. It will always be a masterpiece that you return to once in a while.",5
"Its really good, the gameplay is good and the graphics are good aswell. The only problem is that it get's a little repetitive after a while. Other than that its really good.",4
Upgrade times are so annoying I think it should be sorted out And why are the good things always bought with gems which are very hard to come by At least let them be bought with gems or gold coins at well It's really frustrating And it's not as if the gem mine produces gems very fast I think if this issue is worked out on it would really be a great game,1
"Great game, doesn't take up a lot of your time as the upgrades take a while. Perfect for someone who doesn't want to spend hours upon hours grinding a game.",5
I love this game ive been playing this game for 2 years and i enjoy this game so much i love how they added the master nuilder it gives u more experience in the game i really suggest to play this game since i got to school for 7 hours its a great time to upgrade something and then at the end of school it will be upgraded. i love this game!!!,5
"I love the good game it gud and challenging. I also love because it challenges me and teaches patient and wisdom, it very nice very gud. But the reason I gave it four is because u guys don't really give enough bonus and it wastes time but u guys should bring out bonuses or bonus challenges.",4
"Love the game kinda wish we had some type of feature were we can attack our own bases just to see how we can improve our bases and see what we should do to make it better, over all I really love the game (:",5
The game graphics quality degraded after latest update..when you zoom into the village everything is pixelated and blurred .. it was not like this before I've been playing since 2014,2
"Played this game for like 6 years and then lost my account about 2 years ago but when I tried following supercells steps to get it back they banned my email and stuff from ever making a new account because I was ""phishing accounts"" stupid developers didn't even check to see if the email was the same I could have gotten back in..",3
I am thoroughly entertained however it takes way too long for the upgrades after you get to a certain level it's a little time-consuming but I guess that's the purpose.,3
"It is the best game in the word , You can a lots of things in this game , Especially if you play with your friends you can play together like one hand, and you can also make new friends, from my experience I have had many friends because of this game.",5
The New changes are a bit off ... The graphics becamed blurred and the builder base grass is unspeakably horrendous. But besides questionable visual changes it's still basically the same experience. Nevermind it's back.,5
This game was very good but in day mode I'm on th 8 and I find a good loot base it's th9 max how can i raid on that base tell me and there are also th8 base with 2lacks of loot and the prices of the building are 6lacks Or even 1mil same with the night mode my trophies were 2000 and I have loosed 300 trophies in 2 days because whenever I click the attack button it connect to a bh 7 and I am bh 5 now how will i get back my 300 trophies tell me???,1
"It's almost a year I play and I have a lot of progress in all my account, so far the game was enjoyable especially what kind of event or task are upcoming every week or month with different prize.",5
"Game says update, takes you to play store. No update available, just uninstall or play only options. Choose play, back to game, update available. repeat. Game unplayable at the moment. Happened again with April 22 update. They need to reviewbhow they post/time updates to the play store. Game recognizes time to update, but update not available to download yet. Should resolve itself at some point.",1
"Been playing for going on 7 yrs. To me it's the people you play with, being in the right clan ( exciting ) somewhat, it more of a strategy game. Not sure about this new update may ruin the whole game guess will see.",5
"This game is a little confusing at first (at least for me), but its got a very addicting loop. It's nice to have a constant PvP mechanic where you don't lose all of your resources in you are raided. While the upgrade times can reach multiple days the farther you get, it's something you play for maybe 30 minutes a day and let it do its thing while you live your life. The pricing is fair for the most part and I never really feel like I'm forced to buy anything. Very fun game, 9/10",5
"it was good. never get tired of it.. Even though i lost couple of my accounts before HAHA. EDIT NOW I RATE 1 STAR. IT KEEPS SAYING UODATE IS AVAILABLE YET I WHEN I GO TO OKAY STORE IT JUST SAYS OPEN. WHEN I DELETED AND REINSTALLED, IT STILL KEEPS SAYING THE SAME THING. WOULD FIX THIS. PLEASE. Edit: it's fixed now. TY",5
It seems all my friends love the new update especially me we love the clan capital update but the only problem that we were facing all coc players is the quality the quality of the game is very low its not high quality or 3D quality anymore its starting that i dont like the quality of your game please fix this problem we were looking forward to it thank youüòä im gonna go back here and give 5 stars if the problem is fixed üòä,1
"It's really fun to grind and upgrade, but I'm th11 and the progress has slowed down because of the upgrade time, and upgrade cost, it would be nice for a cost reduction, Its a good game and I understand that the point of the game is to grind but I don't have as much time as other people, and people who spend money, its not fair for free 2 play players, all and all its a 4.2 for me.",4
"The matching is not fair at all, most of the time I would have to skip 10 or more times before I can find a village that I can actually fight because most of the time I would get matched with 1 or 2 levels higher than my town hall. Please fix the matching, thank you. Also can you guys bring back the world chat? I really like chatting with other players not from my clan.",3
"This is honestly by far one of the greatest games I have EVER played on Android or apple it brings players together in fun battles, making new strategic bases to having freindly epic battles with your friends this game has you covered I completely suggest you download it, It is fun for all age groups so why not give it a try !",5
its a five star from my side but this doesnt mean that it is perfect first problem: It takes a lot of time to upgrade buildings second problem: i have been playing this game for 5 years but im still stuck on town hall 11 . On the other hand my friend reached townhall 11 in 1 year . He made purchases that I cant . I cant even buy the season's pass cuz i cant afford it . Plz add an update so players like me can get more magic items so they can upgrade faster,5
anyone who says this game is bad is just wrong. the only problem is how long it takes to build anything. im talking from a week - a week and a half just to upgrade a defense. it makes the game have no purpose to come back to until your upgrades are done and eventually find games that are more interesting in the mean time and leaves this one in the dust. still a great game but please make the build times max at 3 days.,4
Time takes to long to upgrade. Maybe some builder speed ups be nice üëç also the air defense is way over powered to the balloons . Need to higher hp or lower the rate of fire then it be a good game . Seems everything harder at low level when you are just burly starting . Thank you I love the game though,5
"To be honest, I don't see much reason to not play this game, you just attack, get some resources then upgrade some things. For the most part that's the game play loop, but there's upgradeable troops, a different place to go when you make the ship with a whole new battle system",5
"Really enjoyed this game it's fun & addictive due to its simple gameplay, but the problem is few upgrades take too much time and especially the wall are very expensive, also the matchmaking is pretty wierd, coz whenever search for battle I get bases 2-3 times higher level than mine. So do some minor changes and this game will be very epic üëç",5
I love the game. Had 2 accounts until one of them disappeared. The option to switch accounts from the settings no longer exists. My main account is th11 and my second was th8. I would love have my second one back. The in game customer support is trash and never gives answers to my issue which is why im hoping they see this and fix my problem,4
"I could play this for hours straight, the two different bases are interesting, whenever I get bored of one I can just go to the other. While pay to win is a viable strategy here there are enough normal players that it isn't an issue :) not perfect but it's a nice game.",5
"The game can be very very generous to you if you do not pay money AT first, but if you want to keep up with everyone else you're going to have to eventually sink money into the game.... unless you just want to stay at a stagnant level for weeks on end. Clash the game is very fun I'll give it that, but without sinking money into it it's not nowhere near as fun as it can be! but I understand it's model that's why they have other games like",3
"Unbalanced Matchmaking on Night Village, I'm getting matched to villages that are ahead in terms of defenses and troops, I can't win, I can't do anything about it, I need to experience a five game losing streak just to be able to win a game and earn resources for upgrades. Wish that its based on builder hall instead of trophies.",2
"I'm on th 6 now i maxed all except my mine and collector, I'm still upgrading.My only problem is when i search bases that imma about attack, the trophies are very low, sometimes a th8 with a 1 trophy, what i'm supposed to do with my trophy pushing of that amount of trophies,pls if there's any problem about the trophy, fix it. I love this game.",3
The game is very good though there are some down sides. Well first of all its that you have to wait a long time. The more you progress the more time it takes for an upgrade to happen. I think that there should be a nother way to finish it without gems like giving A LOT of in game money to finish as that would be way less pay to win.I think that exept for the more waiting time the more you progress the funner it is. Also when im in clan wars i am put against th8 people but im th5 so i cant play.,5
"It's the best game to kill time and very exciting to play most of my war were excellent and nice I'm not mad with the days in upgrading because it's what should be done, I rate it 3 stars when this game updated it's very infuriating when I'm attacking then it crashes/lost connection/account not in sync it always pop up and then reload then Shoot lost trophy lost battle üò≠üò≠üò≠",3
great game. been playing it for years and its near to perfect when it come to the storage capacity of magic items. i mean its ok to have 1 room for each rune but when we buy it from shops giving real money they have an advantage of having multiple runes of the same resource and even after not spending real money in the game we still have the storage problem so i was thinking if SUPERCELL can make it like 'no storage limit' for the magic item that is to be collected when the clan games end...,3
"Its a great game and I love the graphics. Although there are some times when my phone (which is a very common phone for a Samsung) crashes alot when ever I leave the app by turning off the hole phone and Im abit dissapointed that I cant upgrade my army, home, or even play singleplayer offline. Other than that I love the game very much it is fair, easy, and fun to play with friends.",4
"I've played since early 2013, had a few breaks over the years but have been back playing daily for 3 years now. Honestly a very good mobile game. Always tweaks to balance to keep the game competitive and interesting. New content and QoL updates help massively. Definitely not a pay to win game and requires patience and perseverance. If you choose to buy the Gold Pass it's a very cheap price each month and honestly has great value compred to most mobile games.",5
"The upgrading time is too long and the cost is so high. Also, if there is new legendary hero skin, it should be for the 4 Heroes. I mean, they should match so that they will look good together when attacking. But overall, the game is good. Please make new legendary skins (the same theme for 4 heros). All heroes should have special effects which is far beyond ordinary skin. Make it look more cool and hype. Surely I will buy within a minute.",4
Fantastic game! Playing since 1 year just one update we need is that there should be a daily spin to get magic items and there should be modification in a challenge in the achievement section where we have to defend attacks from even 1 star which is very difficult for trophy pushers so it should be that defend attack from 3 star then it'll be okay. Thank you!,5
"I installed CoC to play with my friends but everytime I open it, it crashes. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarted my phone, turn off and on my WiFi, but nothing is working. Edit: I've checked other reviews and lots of people are having this issue. Supercell, please fix this.",2
"This game is one of best and cool game that won't bore uyou, this game had many cool updates but there is 2 issue that i think you should check it : 1_first bring the switch option on the load page, it really takes a long time to load game then switch and again load game 2_characters has different appearances on different lvls and thats awesome but the appearance of them in barracks same as heroes, when we buy skin at least we want to see an artwork of him. Thanks for your cool game",4
"The game is awesome,it would be so great if there is a way to program the scenarios to change,like if it's night we could do something to activate a scenary darker that we already have automatically,or chance depending of the time of the day we play the game all settled by us, because it would make scenary more fun and I would totally buy another one if that happens.",5
The waiting time is too effing long. I'm th13 and the standard wait times is 16-17 days for two levels each. Too much money involved in this game. As f2p player I can see why rushing is very beneficial. You get to unlock new troops and by the time a big new update comes the building and training time gets to reduce! I highly recommend smart rushing but not too much! You have to keep your heroes updated at least or else you're just an unwanted trash rusher. A big LIABILITY.,1
I have been playing for 2 years now and only in the last 2 months have I experienced issues. Like the game gets stuck on the loading screen. When I delete the game and try to reload it it does not download. Besides that the game is great but issues like this spoil it.,4
Its a very fun game! The only thing I can complain about is I'm at level 76 and I have the warden dude. Waiting 8 days for 1 upgrade!!! I almost can't play the game but for my quick battles to get my start... and also I feel the algorithm for your level don't match the villages u get to invade... like it takes me 15 battles just to get my 5 stars. It costs me more elixir than what u get from the attack!,4
"It's a good game but one issue, I was attacking a village and when I dropped my troops, it just suddenly log out and tell me to update the game, seriously? And my trophies got deducted from that attack as well. It will be great if the devs makes player continue attacking the village or just don't count that as a lost after reconnecting.",3
"Graphics: 8/10. Simple, yet effective. Gameplay: 9/10. It can be frustrating to get raided and lose, but the satisfaction of improving your defenses makes it worthwhile. Music: 7/10. I have heard better, but I have heard much worse. Frames/lag: 9/10. No issues so far with either. Story: 3/10. This is fine since it's not the point of the game. Nobody plays CoC for the story.",5
"Great game, I love it. Only thing I would say for it to be better is for upgrades to be shorter, and so you can control which buildings your troops attack because that can get annoying when they attack the wrong buildings",5
"You'll find it easier to win by spending a couple bucks on a builder pack. Then is just about hopping on after each upgrade, and attacking other players for daily reward, and you'll get a second area which is unlocked when you make your ship. Be warned its even harder, blocked by a even bigger paywall. So if your not into paywalls, avoid this game. If you got a few bucks to spend you might end up liking this game.",4
"I am playing this game since 3-4 years and I am enjoying it. It is a great, good and mind blowing game, I shall give it infinite stars if possible,but to build any building takes a long time, sometimes it takes a day or a week ,this is the only thing which I don't want or likeüòû so I request to reduce the time of building , if my request is accepted then bring it with an update and I shall very happy. And one more request please return the.""Global"" again. Thank you so much SUPERCELL üëçüëçüëçüíü",5
It's a great little game always come back to it. Only thing I feel needs alot of work is combat balancing. Especially in versus mode... im going up against builder halls that have defences I haven't unlocked yet which I find pretty unfair puts me at a disadvantage.... surely we should be pitted against people who are evenly matched?,4
"At my very first time playing this game I hated it because I don't know what to do but now I'm enjoying it and I love it even though it lag's whenever I login it's still the the best and also,I recommend you adding an assassin goblin which target's the hero's first and when the targeted hero is dead they turn back into a normal goblin and target's resources that's all thanks. And a spider as well.",5
"Awesome game 10/10 would recommend. love how you can idle upgrade your base Just press upgrade and come back in a few hours or days and the upgrade is done Plus the strategy when it comes to raiding another base really sepperate the good players from the great You can't just be the best in the world straight away with levels and spending cash on the game, it actually takes time to master it especially since its been out for so long Which really help new players and players in general",5
"COC is an interesting game, i have been playing it for two year, the reason I gave two star is because!! When there's a slightest change in the wifi or net connection, every progress we make gets lost. I faces this and it sucks. After attacking some nice bases, when there's a lil bit change in the network connection the stars we earned and the troops we used everything gets lost and again it returns back to how it was. There's always updates coming,i thought it won't be the same but it is still.",2
"I've been playing this game since before Heroes were introduced. I have lost all interest in playing because the game crashes often when I get into battle (I'm connected to 5G WIFI). When a crash happens, you lose the battle, you have to readjust your troops to compensate for whatever wasn't dropped, and new content barely ever happens. Find another game to invest your time in. You'll have a better end result.",1
Really love the game. It's one of my favourite games for Android. But I just currently started having issues with logging into my account it keeps telling me the same message over and over again that something went wrong. Please am begging u guys to fix the problem I really wanna continue with the clan games.,3
"Entertaining, to say the least. I never thought I'd enjoy this game. However, my one gripe is getting green gems. It is painstakingly slow, unless you buy a package. This pay-to-play aspect, makes the progress of the game altogether halt. And it takes longer to upgrade within your clan.",4
They just updated the game for May and it won't let me.... I need some type of help I really like this game. I'm going to try again but I already tried two times I thought it would just update that I can continue playing but I haven't had any type of progress getting through the game is awesome. I just didn't think that would happen after it went to maintenance it said update but anything didn't happen I don't even have a update button. If anyone can give me advice or if support can help thanks.,5
"I hadn't played this game for a couple of years but it didn't take long before I felt right back at home. Excellent for single players or those who prefer to work as part of a team. Serious planning, superior battle skills and knowing when to take a risk make this game a good one.Suitable for all stages of players.",4
The game is awesome but I wish that the time for upgrading things and training troops for bigger Town Halls should be reduced. It takes a lot of time and makes it a bit boring. I would love it if something would be done.,5
"Very fun and great, oove the game and love the style of it. It's really cool that the things you could buy are really cheap. One thing ai don't like is the amount of gold you need to upgrade your town hall. Other than thay, I really love the game.",4
"I was excited to redownload this game. But I literally can't login to my account. I get codes, but they always say they are old. And most of the time, there is no code sent for dual authentication (including spam). I reached out to customer support and they ""couldn't find my account"". What kind of horrible database system do they have that can't find an account despite me having the email and name associated with that account? Fix this. Let me login to my account. Oh and the UI for this sucks",1
"I love this game. There are a couple of options I'm missing, which is if the game developer makes a revenge button or next village button option when visiting an attacking village. So that we don't have to come back and visit another attacking village. Or if we can see the attacking village online status/or active shield time. That would be pretty cool. üòÅ I'll give you one more ‚≠êüòâ",4
"superb overall experience in this app! :) i hope you can add some features like ""low data cost or data saver"" because some (like me working onboard a ship with a slow internet speed) of players are have a slow internet speed :) thanks! im looking forward to it :)",4
"The town hall 14 needs some more traps, walls, and defences with higher levels and stats for damage per shot, or increase the range of all defences. I keep getting destroyed by people using the same strategy where my base is overwhelmed by the force, and is unable to defend from most if not all attacks. Also the eagle artillery is the worst defence system in the game, the fire rate is extremely slow, and it barely has a chance to do any damage to enemies troops before it gets destroyed.",3
"The game is still good! I stopped playing coc way back 2016 and now in 2022 i came back, just to feel the nostalgia when Covid was still a myth. Anyway i just rate it 4Star because there are some major problem that im in countering that when im finding a match it takes me almost a minute or two just to find a opponent. Please fix these problem, I'll change my ratings when y'all solve the problem. Thank you üëåüòò",4
"I have played many addictive games before but this one is by far my favourite. Always new and exciting ways to move forward and so many various features within the game that I am never bored and always have something to do. I love that prices are reasonable and there's always sales and specials going on. I am very pleased, and plan on playing this game for quite a while.",5
Clash of clans is the excellent game. Very good graphics. But the problem is when troops are deployed to attack the trops are not staying together to attack. Through this mistake i defeated many times. Please correct this mistake .,3
It's way to slow and not enough resources to really build a decent clan. I keep having to surrender to exit with only one guy left and wait for 20-30mins destroying most buildings. There should be a fast forward for this. Otherwise it's just not worth waiting for. Unless you are using a multiple screens for other games you would rather play while it does it's thing. üôÑ Please fix!,3
"Worst algorithm ever that is used in a game . In builder base it is even more utter disappointing that whenever the troops or builder battle machine is going towards town hall to attack even though they break walls , they don't even go inside and attack it . Instead they turn all the other way around and avoid the player to earn a star . This is all selfish style which demands players to get upset and play the game .. even there are plenty of videos showing that the game has too much errors .",1
"2/16/22 This morning I started the game hoping that my builders have finished the upgrades... But while being in the loading screen a pop up appears saying that an update is available, exactly like this; Update is available! Good news! A new version of the game is available. The thing is that I pressed the only button that is ""Upgrade"" and it taked me to the Play Store where the last update was in December 10 from (obviously) 2021. I have tried clear the cache but it's the same story.",5
Fun and not really pay to win. It's a game where you NEED patience unless you want to go in debt. You can make your village in so many different ways to make it perfect for you. Would recommend if your looking for a game that will take 2 years+ to max out.,5
"Love this game, but the season pass is little rigged imo, it's very hard to complete. I still haven't completed mine and there is only 24 hours left till the new season. Please fix it, otherwise I will stop buying the monthly pass... Because honestly, the 20% discount, Ive hardly ever been able to use full advantage of it. This is still my favorite supercell game",4
Very very good game! When it lets me in. I keep having this repetitive problem of getting to a specific point of loading and then kicking me out. Would give it a five but the problem has knocked it down to a four,4
"best game ever, This game is focused on strategy and attacking strat, The heroes are like the bigger version of some troops but more power full, it has good quality and graphic and you can change your name at th 5 which is quite a good feature because if you misspelled your name you can correct or change it, and the deffence is a insperation if there is a zombie apocalypse ( Just Kidding XD ) Thats why i rate it 5star",5
"9 year player, I use 15 accounts. I have nothing but complaints, biggest one being inexcusable ai for troops, attacking is rage inducing with minimal care for balancing. Each time you use an army (on the same base) it will produce different results. War league and wars in general are a joke, zero consideration for progression of players. Update: abandoned all bases, at the start of th14 (fully maxed 13) it is not even fun to win wars anymore. Impossible to enjoy this game, play something else.",1
"It is the best game I have, after school this is what I look forward to. There are no ads, and progress is slow but that's ok with me. And plz make troops a little challenging but not so much to get. Keep this game going my fav at the moment. And when is clash heroes going to be global?",5
"You still didn't fix your damn connection. It always throw me out of the game when I attack my opponent. This happen many times when the wifi logo appears, the progress I have made will automatically won't save and I always got a 0% attack on my opponent. It always makes me frustrated when that happens and not by once but many times üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§",1
"Overall I think this game is great, I love how you can make your own defense and base in your own way and learning the games mechanics is pretty easy. I fell in love with the game right when i started playing, best of all Is that there's no adds. Great game keep up the good work",5
"Well my opinion about this game is very good, but the problem is that some upgrades take much time like 15 days.... It also does got much flags. I request to add all national flags or least 100. Overall the best game I ever played, One of the top games on mobile.",4
Timeless classic!! Hands down the best mobile game created. The perfect base building game with great gameplay. I have been playing this game for years and I have got to say I still don't get tired of it!!! And to make the game just that little bit better there are no ads.,5
"The game is great but it keeps disconnecting during the worst times like war, and when you reconnect with the game it doesnt load you back to your game but just leaves it before you disconnected. It's definitely an app problem because my wifi bar is always up during attacks. Please fix",3
"Very Integrating. Worth investigating time in cause ur not always needed to stick to this constantly, construction takes a while and you can train a certain amount of troops and train them to so you cant just constantly attack either. This makes this a great side game.",4
"It is my fave game I literally love it The game is so cool and I can only think of a few improvements: 1. Just like in hayday and boom beach (yes at 1 point I have played your games supercell although I hate everdale), you should get a statue to recognise that you have a supercell ID (that one is optional) 2. There should be global chats again 3. The time and expense should be reduced because when you get to a lvl2 inferno tower it takes 5 days to get to lvl3 though that it can go to lvl9",5
"We really wish that there was a clock tower in home village,and it takes a long time to get upgraded. By the way,this game consumes a lot of time which really isn't good. Overall we could say ok but still it consumes time a lot for upgrading things.",2
"Best game since the 1st generation apple tablet. But obviously need to change the AI routes for P.E.K.A, he needs a change because he goes all the way around the base instead of immediately going inside the base and destroying stuff inside the base.",5
"Game is really fun to play at times but definitely need to fix the upgrade times, it is outrageous waiting 9 days for one build to get done, but overall this is a very fun game, graphics are good and you go against people with similar bases to you.",4
"I'm having issues while logging into the game. It is crashing everytime I try to open it. The game stops in the ""loading screen"" after loading for a while. Is it a bug or something? I tried re-installing the game too.",4
"If you are a kind of player who looks to progress in game for a long term then this game is ideal for you! This is such a Masterpiece that i had played continuously for several years and had good progress. Anyways, This is a Wonderful Strategy game which has Single and Multiplayer mode which enables us to raid other clash villages, Build your own clan and lead it to glory and Have Fun!",5
Love this game I really recommend you can build your own base attack other people's base's. There's absolutely no adds. I like how if you upgrade something you can come back later and it'll be finished upgrading. Overall great game I recommend,5
"Great game, would definitely recommend to other people. This game is amazing and the anti cheat and ban system is too good. The game is balanced and is easy to play yet is also fun. The only reason I left it as 4 stars, is because you can only play online. If you could add a feature with offline mode. But keeping it fair for online players too, I'd play every day. Thank you supercell of this amazing game! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",4
It is amazing game you get to fight and build also upgrade. You can also have a clan and you can invite your friends. Also the bad thing about it is the building and the upgrading can take a while.,4
I don't like how higher level players can wipe out my base when my base is only level 3 and doesn't have any counters to airborne units. Just some food for thought. Overall an average replacement for Star Wars Commander which I miss badly. I'll possibly raise the stars after a month playing.,3
"Hey! I picked up this game recently after not playing it in 5 years. I felt a certain nostalgia and love towards this game and really wanted to try it out again, and my friends, it wasn't just nostalgia. This game is entertaining, and has made several improvements since I last played, like the troop assortments. 5 stars",5
"The game is really enjoyable for me and it's even more so after i stopped playing in a long time, the thing i noticed is how COC now offers battle passes..... hence my preoblem. why is the battle pass offer doesn't give back in game currency? Every other titles battle pass gives you back enough in game currency to buy back the battle pass next season, it's even more expensive than other titles battle passes, thanks for responding dev team",3
"Great game to sit down and play, the reason I'm rating It 4 stars is because you can buy gems to progress, while I can't blame the game for trying to make money, the game could be harder for people who don't spend money. Another complaint I had is that upgrading items can take forever.",4
"It really is sad that base design doesn't seem to matter, the gem price gouging seems excessive. I get it's a child friendly game but wish there was more control over the troops. Also, there are a few troops that are fun (valk, hog riders, miners, minions) but are ineffective at higher town halls. But I wouldn't know how to make them viable. I guess I just miss spamming valk and golem in th10. It's an alright game, but I progression were a bit faster.",2
"The game is fun enough, but if anything at all goes wrong get ready for the worst customer support experience of your entire life. I was trying to buy something and kept getting an error code. After contacting support I received 2 or 3 automated/copy paste answers and then when asked if my problem was solved and I responded that it wasn't, they essentially said ""sucks to be you"". It's very difficult to give any game or app more than 1 star when the people in charge of it care so little.",1
"Very bad experience, I'm th11 and during attack it says connection lost and I can't continue. I have an high-speed internet connection. I play lot of other online games.. Never faced any network issue. It's frustrating when I deploy one troop and connection lost. I can't continue the attack. Please fix this issue or give an option to continue the attack before attack time ends..",1
"Great game. Terrible support. Probably one of the worst support systems. DEV email is full as well. They can certainly can collect money from us without difficulty or delay. Shame, been playing for a long time.",1
Builder Base match making sucks! Imagine a bh6 versus a rushed bases or fully upgraded bh7 or bh8 face off. You can only hope that your opponents are dumb enough to lose against my base. I seldom match up with opponents the same bh level as mine and it's a closed call game. It's kind of frustrating that you have to lose 200 trophies first in order to win a measly 30 trophies because of the stupid matchmaking!,1
"I love the game... Want to give a suggestion, of adding a 'GIVE UP' option in VERSUS BATTLE. After attacking if the player founds that his opponent has gain more percent of victory then he can choose an option of 'GIVE UP'. Watching the full invasion is time consuming. Please add this feature.",4
Amazing game but it's really anoying when I'm continuing to disconnect so if that gets fixed I'll edit to 5 other than that you don't have to pay to win and the pay to win people are pretty much gone before they can get ahead so the start is a little bit pay to win but even then it's optional.,4
"A CLASSIC! This game is just a real classic and super enjoyable and fun, the thing i dont like is the long building times, and its not that good free to play because progression is much slower. So i reccomend to buy the extra builders, you can get the builders on your own though but its way slower.",5
I have been playing this game for the last 7 years off and on and I LOVE IT! I have had to start over several times due to changing phones and not saving my progress but I have starting over down pat.,5
"Game is great, no problems, no bugs. The only problem is the rediculous amount of money(gold) you'll need to upgrade a wall, and upgrading traps also take time and it's taking too long",1
Months after emailing that the app crashes when an attack has started they still haven't fixed the issue. I can no longer play on my phone which is an issue when not at home to play on the tablet. Several war attacks get missed...,1
"The gameplay is great, game quality in graphic is very good, minimum bugs there is. But troops are so stupid they distracted easily and scattered everywhere in the map. Thay are more stupid to be called even the troops...",2
Honesty this game is great. It runs well and has decent graphics. I can only list one problem in that everything takes so long to build and upgrade. Other then it's pretty good!,4
"This game is yet good. But the problem is we don't get enough xp now comparing the past. Before when we did maxed town hall 7, our xp level used to be around 62-65. Now, we can't even reach level 60 after maxing town hall 7. I guess the main reason is that now we don't get xp from upgrading or building something in builder base. Supercell please fix this issue.",3
It is a very fun game. Just one thing that bugs me (and I know this is how the game is supposed to be) is that the upgrades take forever once your like on town hall lvl 6 or 7. But other than that it's a really good game.,4
I like this game it's fun to raid villages and build your own village what I'm not so fond of is the pay to win aspect unless you pay for gems the game goes pretty slow will building needed to be upgraded and troops needed to be trained over all not a big issue though because once you finish something you're doing it feels more rewarding,4
"Good game, takes a really long time to upgrade but that's part of the game. If you didn't have a long term goal it wouldn't be enjoyable. Main base is fun and war is awesome but the builder base needs to be reworked attack wise and imo needs more content",5
"Great game! Diverse army for multiple attack strategies, as well as many different defenses to build your base as you like. Support is mostly helpful. Not pay to play, but many options to advance more quickly.",5
"I have a major problem and I do not know if it is my device or not, I cannot get past the loading screen.the loading bar gets halfway there and the game just crashes ,this is recently and I have not had any problems with the game before this, my experience before this has been great, I love this game except for this issue",3
"Best game I have ever seen . Graphics, animation,voice every thing is amazing. I never get bored it in 5 years . The only problem is that when I am near to max my buildings and researchers takes up to 18 days , If u can please reduce this time",5
"The troop and hero AI is so broken this game is now virtually unplayable and has become worse with every patch. Troops will attack 4 different walls to get to the same target, Queen will run too close to targets, clone spell spawning is completely random, some defenses shoot further than their range, th14 poison bomb is stupidly OP, dragons & balloons will attack targets further away instead of closest ones, and so on. Oh and upgrade times are nearly 1 month long. Lazy, clueless devs.",1
I have always loved this game But am beginning to get fed up I am into trophy pushing but still always very annoying when I get very little trophies from attacks but still lose a lot from defence Pls look into this aspect of my game I have a lot of accounts I may end up leaving the game It's very annoying,4
"Irritating and frustating AI of some characters. Been playing since 9 years now. i would stop playing this game just how Irritating AI of some characters are like battle machine in builder hut, dragons, king, ultra short span of spells, very short life of witches. Things that are main attraction of this game are limited and ruined just for greed. i am sure developers will find lot more opportunities to monetize with smart characters than dumb characters.",5
Played this game since I was an itty bitty boy. --- Suggestion: Can we have the shovel of obstacle turn obstacles into decorations? I have collectible obstacles from past seasons that i'd love to save to a menu.,5
Absolutely disgusting... The fact that this game has lagged out so many times during clan matches when there is nothing wrong with my internet is just ridiculous... THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY! If you lag out of an attack in clan wars you need to be able to continue the fight. Instead if it lags out it stops your attack. I have ZERO STARED 3 people in clan wars due to this issue. I have spent a lot of money into this game and if this happens to me one more freaking time I'm done with it,4
I only started to play this when I activated a ¬£25 Google voucher and it gave me an additional ¬£10+ worth of game points and perks. Ever since iv been addicted to the game and spent more money in app. GOOD way to get more people they got me lol üòÜ saw me comming,5
Very nice game all things are good I give 3stars because I have only 1 problem that is TIME houses.. troops.. building.. are takes so much time.. in next update please solve it otherwise all things are perfect... I like this game so much and the thing that I like very much that is If we connect to Supercell we got our village after redownload...,3
"Dear developers, please listen to your players that gives you one star ratings. They including myself can't load the game after the update. My friends are also experiencing this issue. Hope this will be fixed soon. We've tried all sorts of things clearing data reinstalling it but noting happens. Please fix this as soon as possible",1
"This game is great but there was a one problem,I was playing for 2 weeks now and I'm at th6 and silver 3 but I can't go up because theirs a lot of stronger(like th8 & 9) players that attacking my village and that's why my trophies always decreasing and I can't go up. Hope u guys fix it.",2
"Iam playing this game since 2014 untill now ,I'll stop for a while then I played again ,it's just my proses ,but with this new update with clan capital it's make me fell existing to play again ,I rate only 3 star due to this bug that it's all ways reloading it's really ruin my train trops every time its disconnected ,I hope super cell will do something on it on their next maintenance update ,thanks super cell in my heart your all be 5star for me",3
This game is litterally the best game I have ever seen. The graphics are also good and the game itself is so fun to play. I'm currently at TH 11 and after the cost reduction I have upgraded so many things and I loved the new update. But I want Pakistani flag to be added in Clash of Clans because so many players are starting to download the game and they need a flag of their country to place on their base.,5
"Updates for my Galaxy Tab A are a nightmare to perform. Won't load, just keeps returning me to the PlayStore, with ""Play"" as the only option. Junk!",1
Seems like the developer has lost interest. Been fully built out on VS for at least a year with no update or path forward in sight. Almost maxed at multi player with little or no real game enhancement in recent past and nothing on the horizon. :(,3
"The game is great, and it has a great deal of content, but it's a bit too pay to win. I love that it has no ads, but maybe make the progression a bit faster, and make it so gems are more for cosmetics instead of for game progression e.g. builder huts.",4
I'm on the last townhall. The devs will give you monthly skins for gold membership. The last matching skin is always behind a double price paywall along with some ugly map to finish it off. I've come across some nice base backgrounds. The ones down days are just pure lazy. The game is buggy. It's a pure cashgrab. Dumb AI is part of the challenge. Your turnover rate for an entire clan will be 90% a month. People die of boredom before finishing this game. The grind is so bad and unrewarding.,1
The game is good I like playing in free times but the reason for 4 star is that in laboratory only one troop can be upgraded at a time thats the problem because defense don't take much time to get max but the problem is of spells and troops upgrdation thats why I suggest that you must give two space on laboratory means we can upgrade two things at a time so it would be easy for maxing the troops please go through my message.,4
"The Gameplay is superb, and so is the sound response and every troop having their particular strategy of attacking, Really cool buttons, Excellent landscape display,Cool heroes ability that make you want to upgrade town hall for a better village, Then on the builder base Excellent gameplay there too, But I feel like one troop is missing, on the next update, could there be a troop that steals opponent's building, defence but not town hall, and then let's me build it on my village pls?",5
"VERY FUN! Got new phone and I had the Google play installed and got my Town Hall 9 back which I really like about this game, your villages save to your accounts but you can choose to start a new village instead. You can also make different saves where you can have multiple bases, it takes about 10 seconds to swap which is really good aswell",5
This game is great but it would be better if it was three dimensional like you can see your troops fighting it might take up more storage button that is fine . EDIT: i wish you could controll your heroes but like last time this game is overall pretty great,4
This is a good game. But there are some problems like when you are in upper town halls you need to spend huge gold to update your buildings and you also need to spend you times.But still it is a good game .,5
"It's an awesome game, but there's this bug or something because I can't buy anything. It's all gray and everytime I click on the product it says ""transaction pending"" but I didn't buy anything so I don't know",3
Such a fun game attack people and you get to build your base. You get to defend against others. Your friends can even join you one of the best games I had in a long time.,5
"This is the one of best game ever for me, but problem is when I donated drops to someone he didn't got drops . Sometimes it happened with me , please solve this glitch we don't need any disgusting event, thank you so much üôè",5
The game itself is good but the matchmaking of the game is just not fair. im still on builder hall lvl 2 and my enemies are sometimes lvl 5+ and have more troops than me. anyways this is good game at all!,4
I'm a long time player of coc but recently I'm facing a problem. It keeps showing me downloading content but it never loads.i have good wifi.(will change review once the bug is fixed.pls fix your game. I don't wanna miss this raid weekend,2
"Been playing the game since it came out back in 2012, Absolutely love it. Especially the detail to animation and character development!! üòÅüíØ",5
I am giving 1 star because when I am opening the game then lading coming but after loading my game is got closed automatically and after lading a black screen is also coming . Please solve this issue as soon as possible . I have send so many reports also but nothing happens .,1
Very good game i had it as my child hood game and it was amazing. still is! what gets me the most is the time. it makes you wait when you upgrade which is really realistic,5
"Even though, i have a strong internet connectivity, during attack base matchmaking, it fluctuates so much. It shows a WIFI symbol that means my internet not stable. Very dissatisfied.",3
Best game I have ever played my personal favourite. Average Graphics. Very good content and many things to do exciting game and a time eater. I suggest to download this game you will be addicted to this game.,5
Supercell please maintain the update bugs which is madness don't increase the upgrade time and cost ok super updates please reduce elixir and time forupgrading queen and king slightly!! Ok nice game i am playing from 3 years then the winter update ruined things that i cannot open app and login my identity if this is not fixed i would report anyway i need this game,4
Love this game.. playing since 2016.. But after the last update some glitch and bugs are annoying me..i dont know about others.. but some time my game screen become black..please fix this problem supercell.. üíö,3
Facing Network issue to play Game..Showing About wifi symbol.. even my internet connection is good .. It's always gets a glitch when update releases.. still having this problem..fix this issue permanently.. still having this problem.,1
This is the best game I have ever played but I want some more items in the league shop. And also if you donate some troops your army gets disturbed please fix this also. THANK YOU SUPERCELL FOR THIS GAME. CLASH ON,5
"After the Updating the last updated application work properly for some days then after not able get load and if load, application done not work. So please do the need full and let me know when will able to play this game again.",1
Great game I love playing it but recently I haven't been able to play. When I try loading in the bar only says downloading content but it's stuck at the beginning.,2
By far the best base-building and progression game I have ever played.. and I've tried many! Great Graphics and design! Thank you for developing such a great game!!!,5
"i give 2 stars right now because base on my experience, the available loot in multiplayer attack was so cheap, and the upgrade has very long time to wait.",2
"Exhuastingly Exciting filled w/desperate anticipation to see when that next build will finally drop. Torn between the constant exercise in patience or the inevitable battle against that ""dude you can't pronouce or read's"" name from across the world who bought 'Eeveerything' (plus the walls) in their castle to the max! so to prove just how slow it is to compete by the rules can be...hood times. The cartoony scripts are the hit tho'!...very cool.~ish...",5
The app keeps blacking out and crashing after the loading screen. Unable to login to my account. Fix this bug.,1
"The recent capital update is damn interesting üòÉüòÑ... I was getting bored of this game in between but whenever i get bored, the raid weekend starts and gets me back into the game üòÅ.. just wanna tell that u can add a builder potion in the raid medals shop..",5
"The wait is impatient. Builder, upgrade, hero train should not be included. The wait is very frustrating for the game player.",1
"The game is awesome, as always. There are always new events coming up and it's fascinating to hink that this game still has much craze after some much time. This game never goes stale!",5
Best mobile game in my opinion can be boring tho when u get to higher town halls but just started on my builder base so you always have something to do and especially with the clan capital best addition but I reckon they need to add a new builder hall level cause I'm nearly maxed out builder hall now and I've been doing that base for 3 months,5
"Remember playing this game back then when I was a kid,now after years again download it, feels a lot of nostalgia nothing has change just there's are some upgrades in the game but it's still feel amazing thank you for making such a gameü§ç",5
This is best game ever but I want that developers pay attention towards some issue. * Pls add some more townhall in builder base * In forge we can use only home town builder not otto builder why. I have upgraded all things my exiler are full builder gold are full i want to use them but where . Pls allow otto also in forge Rest of all everything is superb Game deserve 5 star,4
Good game only issues I have is I've been banned for 31 days 3 times trying to recover one of my older accounts. supercell continuously accuses me of account phishing and bans without mercy. It doesn't matter if youve spent a million dollars on this game or if you've been playing since day one and all because it was a long time ago and I can't remember what device I used to play on. Oh and general contact with the company about this issue isnt an option. They don't care about their gamers.,2
"I'm having a good time playing it, but there's only one thing that's just not going well and that is the upgrade cost of heroes. Gaining dark elixir is so hard even with the clan castle or the attack bonus it is still hard to gain dark elixir. So pls do something about it, either to decrease the upgrade cost or improve the dark elixir collectors or it's up to you. Just pls do something.ü•∫",5
"It is nice game for entertainment. This game have no fault and there was no ads in this game which is very good. I have my town hall 13 I'd I reach on town hall 13 in 2 years and my I'd is new on th 13 there are so many interesting events in it which entertain us. Like clan games,season challanges,cwl etc",5
I love it! ive been playing for a month now its has good graphic but the town hall price is so expensive when you place your troops iy has a good sound also make an update about the clan capital anyways its a good game,5
Solid game been playing it on and off for 7 years the grind can get a bit old but Supercell released an update making all upgrades cheaper so it isn't as hard to level up any more which is greatly appreciated,4
I really enjoying to play this game...nice graphics....nice character....also playing softly....but I give you 3 star because now a days i saw a problem...when I open this app sometimes app automatically stop or crash... developers please solve this out....thank you,3
If practice mode allow us to edit the army and make different types of attack strategy.I loose many loot if I were to try my new attack strategy.I hope suppercell add this feature in future.,4
"I downgrade my review from five stars to 1 star, why? Because I always queued a battle against a higher base level from versus battle (not ""multiplayer battle"") and I'm sick of it! Its been a year and the battle is still unfair!! Can you do something about it?! üëéüèøüëéüèøüëéüèøüëéüèøüëéüèø‚≠ê",1
Amazing game only thing is that in the higher levels of buildings it can start to take a week to upgrade otherwise great game I never get board when I play!,5
This game is good way better than clash royale bc i can make villages and i can customize them and i can attack people and participate in clan wars and upgrade my units and my resource deposits i can also make my own defense. All i have to say this game is the best game of supercell,5
"Awesome, fun, it makes you really think and having that in a game helps, all out I think it's really amazing and they do and did a great job with the game!!!!",5
The game takes a long time to get open...it shows that the bar is loading but still it takes a long time...please fix this as soon as possible,2
Great game and a long game with long pauses in the game play but it's a little pay to win but you can get to the best without paying a dime and you can't beat the game in just a few days.,5
"So many bugs,when i attack in clanwar and i lost internet,it just waste 1 clan war attack,this bug so annoy me like 1 war attack is very important and you'll lose it with bad internet? Pls fix it ill change my rate if you fixed it",1
Better at the beginning. The game has gone down here. Only being pay to play. Everybody has a bought base or/and army. Makes it difficult to win facing these type of people.,3
Whenever I try to open the app it crashes immediately and I can't play the game at all even if I try to open up the app like 10 times.,1
"I've been playing this game for 9 years, and I am very addicted to this game... I wish there was a Loot Gifting System to our fellow clan mates to help them grow... I hope this feature will be in the game (:",5
You all got a lot of fixes to do. I'm tired of getting disconnected in the Scout phase of my attack and then getting 0 stars when it disconnects...,1
Best game ever love it so much.. but at some point when town hall is at lvl8 or 9 they just spam you with dragons and you can't win. But overall it's my favorite game to play online,5
"Overall, the game is very good and engaging but in clan chat ,it censors a lot . Even normal words get censored and we cannot talk to others . We expect developers to fix the problem as it is an issue of many clans.",3
Aiit. First of all this game is good been playing it for a long time but after this update the match making system is kinda getting on my nerves.....How do you expect a Town hall 11 to get a 3 star against a max town hall 14. I think it would be ok if Town hall 11 get to be matched up with Town hall in legends league not town hall 14 because it makes it look like those Town hall 11 players are there to give free trophies to those Town hall 14 player.,1
I have played the game for years on different phones and stuff but I got a free big bundle from a code. And it shows up on my phone but I can't download it.,4
I love this gameü•≥... I'm playing it I think 2 months then I'm (TH 9) so farü§ß...all in all this game is awesome and entertaining no need to be harsh of Ur resources just be humble and be wise in depending and offending from Ur enemy ‚ù§Ô∏è... Must try it!!!,5
The help and support team are extremely efficient and helpful. I have never once been disappointed by this game in the entire 9 years i've played,5
One of the best games in the world all types of features are there in it .but u must add one more features in which we can chat with our friends without being in same clan overall the games is fabulous,5
"This game is very well üôÇ. But, a problem that it's online. So everyone should download this game and play this. Thanks to the developers of Clash of Clans ( Supercell )",5
I am continuesly playing clash of clans for 3 years. this game is never change for me because I love this game very much and the upcoming new updates are good which makes it more interesting.,5
"Its been 11 year since I was playing this game, but now came to know its not you who play this game its COC who is playing, you dont controll your trophies, its COC who controlls it, COC isnt fare at all they favours only players who pays to them, 80 percent players endup with frustration and now one more added, never play this game if you want peace of mind..... uninstalled!",1
"Ever since the newest update I have an issue. I updated the game and play store doesn't show another update button so there isn't another update, but when I open the game it still tells me to update. I can't open the game, devs :( I'm scared do delete and download the game again cuz I don't wanna lose all my progress",5
"It's fun but I will give only 3star because it's became long time we request flag of ""NEPAL"" but still no response from your side.We have lots of players from nepal, just because of flag lots of players they are not playing so please we support you don't break our hope we need flag of NEPAL .",3
Good game.... But question ! Why army decide targets ? Some time we do not win battle because army does not target desirable point. Plz improve regarding this matter There is option to set target by chief and all army dedicate to that target.,3
***Bug : game getting interrupted on wifi i have 100 Mbps connection but works fine on mobile data. Very bad network experience.,2
Its good game the reason why i rate this game just for 4 star is while u upgrade hero or any troops or defense its take u an hour to finish the upgration...so please kindly lessen the time for the upgrade thats all... but over all its a good game ....,4
"I rate it 5 star beause for the countinuation the last month,were I play this,I thought I gonna lost it because it's not connected through any accounts so I owe you one...so this is it a 5 star. Thanks : )",5
"Recently update crashes the games , unloading screen and totally black out, the phone turns to untouchable and overheating. Please fix this thank you",1
This good for playing I am playing from 2year But now there is a bug that some time loading don't start because of that I have to delete and install that used my lot of net Please fix this problem,4
"Disgusting! Even at your lower town hall levels extremely above tier players attack at your bases and it does same in builder base 1v1,it matches with player that have many powerful troops and defences unlocked.",1
Best game ever for the phone graphics and gameplay and over all experience goes beyond my expectations. You guys did an amazing job keep up the good work and thank you,5
"Good game, played for a very long time but it really bothers me that you censor innocent words such as Masters, Valkyrie or even Welding names such as Miller Millermatics, I try to have conversations with my clan members and it never gets easier because it tags different words everytime, and i have chat filter off and that still doesnt work, please fix this issue as it makes it difficult to havr conversations",2
Connection problem expecially during war... Just put my archer queen and suddenly lost Connection.. not to mention that i can't resume the attack.. Make me lost war and didn't get any star.. Please make a server for other country to play to...,1
"I've played this game for a while probably around 10 yrs, its really an on and off game but recently they have been adding a ton of stuff that has made the game a lot less boring.",5
So as I was upgrading to a town hall 11 after it was done upgrading after a took a break from the game it wouldn't let me back into the game.,2
"The game is very addictive it has a lot of new troops since i last played this game,the game is a dope strategy game that can have unique strategies not gonna lie this is the best game ive ever played.",5
"The best game i have played till now, playing since 3 years, but after new update the game crashes every now and then, I hope supercell fixes this, after all the game is too good üëç‚ô•Ô∏è",5
"Buggy, constant crashes. It a mobile app but needs Pc level performance to run smoothly. Too much add-on have spoiled game",1
"Gotta say, this is one of the strategy games that don't have that much paywall, even if you go f2p, you can still catch up to whales by having that much patience and good base planning, loved it since 2016",5
This is probably the best strategy game out there so many troops you can play it long time it takes a Hella long time to complete the game tho the updates are pretty slow I highly recommend this game,5
"It's essentially a life-long game, which needs patience and strategic thinking. + please increase builder base balloons' health, because they die way too soon",5
I start playing it in third class it is so fun that I can't imagine it all the things which make it so fun are that strategies graphics how it works I am playing it now even I am 15 I fully recommend you to download this appüôÇ if you have patience than download the game,5
"spill make coc when you enter the game the screen breaks down it just says that there is no connection my signal is strong! You thought the game was really good, but it's ugly! Ugly game!",1
In all games that I played you have the worst signal compare to Cod and games where many player are in that field yet I can play freely while yours is always reconnecting I lost many games because of this issue,1
The game is good but the support system really bad dude hahah if u guys need help they will lock your account and ask many question and if u cant remember all the answer they banned/lock your account until u remember the answer LOL just steal our money and our times !!!,1
I am a veteran of this game üéÆ i playing this game from2016.now heve a fully maxed townhall 14 base with all upgrades .so i want that the new update would come soon as possible . I have suppersell id üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ any way i was not talking about this but i want to say that this is the best online game than anyothersüò§üò§üò§,5
This is my one of the most favourite games. I love it so much. It is a beautiful strategical game. But we should be careful that we don't get addicted to this. It's kinda addictive.,4
"Today in the noontime i tried to login, it says maintenance was still in progress, i waited for that time, but till now i cant login..what is going on??? can you plis fix this issue",2
I think clash of clans is a really fun game and you can make a clan with your friends and do clan wars it is a super fun game I have been playing since I was 5years old so I've been playing for 8 years it's super fun I highly recommend,5
This is just fantastic ‚ù§Ô∏è.i play this masterpiece from 2015 but now it have a bug that when I open capital peak it just black and game crash i try reinstall but it not solve please fix it.üòã,5
Plezzz reduce the upgrade time in th11 + town halls... because its a game only but he takes real time like 14days...18days...and there is a problem after clan capital update...when i start the game.... Screen black and auto back and game not opening and game crush problems...plezzz solve it....,1
It's very fun i love seeing my village grow and become more and more powerfull and the upgrede times i can deal with but it would be nice if they were shorter.,5
I really love playing this game but my only concern is that everytime I search for attack it's hard to find an opponent that has a lot of loots.,5
"Probably an ok game. I'll never know though as the fonts used are a garbled mess, far too small, and impossible to read",1
"I really love this game, this game is just like real war, I like the Theme and the characters, the setting, sound etc... Overall I love this game ü§óü§ó.",5
Its been 6 years since i start playing this game and still one of the best game ever...The Support shift is very helpful when my account got hacked and they help me to recover it and now im to play this game. The removal global chat have a big impact in terms of communication and social interaction between the players and i hope the devs will consider to bring it back.,5
I've been playing this since 2015 and I love this game but now you cant even get revenge to the ones who attack you because they have a shield its been weeks now that I cant get revenge to that player and I always see now Is either high TH level with high loot but high defense or high TH level but low loot and low defense if I attack the low loot ones Im the one who lose resources pls do something about the shield or please make town hall rush a bit hard to level in TH5 and up.,3
"It's a great game when you play from the start but when it gets to th9-th14 the upgrading takes to long like a weeks or so that's why people lose intrest in playing coc, ik this is a part of the game but it's just not fun to wait that long thou so Im writing this a for second time and as a player too I'd like you guys to take it into consideration and do something about it because we might lose all the players in a blink of an eye so please do something about the upgrading processes Thank you",4
"Been playing this game since I was elementary. Now that I'm turning college, this game popped out of my mind. I downloaded it again and nostagia flooded me. Unfortunately, my old account's inaccessible already for it's connected on my facebook account. I made a new one last week and I'm hours near to Town Hall 6. I miss my old friends in this game, I hope they're good.",5
"After the new update every time i click on the switch accounts, my game freezes and crashes after a few moments. I reinstalled the game after uninstalling it. But problem is same. Please fix this.",5
This game only scam you because I have 480 gems and I only need 20 more diamonds to have another builder hut but then I opened My profile place and in missions place there was a mission that I only needed 11 more trophies to win 450 gems and when I completed it so I go to claim my gems but there not a mission like that means it disappear and then I uninstalled the game please don't install it,1
Everything's good. I've spent like 50 dollars for you guys. I just want someone to hop on fixing the create a clan button I have all of the requirements yet the actual purchase to create the clan fails everytime. The games fun but it's got some major lag issues. Can someone email me back telling me it should be fixed?,3
One suggestion from me. In the training practice grounds you should let us use our own army instead of teaching us with the pre-made army that supercell provided so that we can practice as many army composition as we like and learn faster on how to attack .,4
The game itself is a really cool game to play the only thing that I would say is bad about the game is the fact that there need to be levels within the game because I keep getting attacked by people that are three times stronger than I am and that makes the game annoying to play but all in all I get the game five stars and it would be nice if they made levels and also when you get done attacking somebody you shouldn't be able to put up a shield,5
"My experience of this game is super awesome this game is the funniest game I've played in a long time it's really fun, Interesting, and a really good strategy game. Creators you did a good job on this game.",4
The higher level you get the slower the game feels and the less you play because upgrading a cannon takes 1/3 your gold and 3 and a half days and most of the time when you attack someones base you get a small amount not even a quarter of the cheapest upgrade. back in 2012-2017 incredible game 2018-2023 meh game,3
I give one not for bugs not for graphic not for non fiction or fake magic bsed story game . The bigest problem is that games crashes anytime when playing when travel to builder base and the most time game crashes when i am logging another id,1
i'm rating this app 1 star because since i updated it . May phone often crashes. It often blacks out and that sucks man. My phone is Realme 7i. Hope you fix this problem so that i can stillplay this game,1
"After recent update, all my troops and heroes went back to level 1... You have any idea how long it'd taken me to upgrade all this? Such unprofessionalism and incompetence on the part of developers of this game is deplorable! Your update brought bugs instead of fixing them. Shame on the developers!",1
The game is great to play but the Help and Support section is not good. I have personally messaged them 5-6 times but my complain did not get looked at. I have lost a clan because of a toxic player. And Supercell is not doing anything.,2
A very interesting game lots to do but it's hard to get gems like I had to spend money because it barely gives you chances to get the gems to skip upgrades because they take forever.,5
"The only 2 things stopping me from giving this game a 5 star rating is that I wish when ur in battle you can click on the building you want some or all your troops to attack, and I wish it was just a little easier to get more gems",4
"Excellent game, thank you to all the developers, creators and everyone involved in making this game an absolute sucess. Thank you for listening to the players and doing the necessary updates üëåI have been playing since 2017 and the new clan Capital is absolute fun üëç yes ! Just one question: my builder base master builder is not doing anything - builder base is maxed. I would like to use him to also forge ... Thanks üî•üí•",4
I know that the new update is good but the game is crashing and it is bugging i have more space in my storage and i keep deleting some of my apps and it didnt work pls fix the bug please i lost to many capital raids because of the bug pls fix coc's bug,4
I can't log into my account. The game shows that i have townhall 7 loaded account but after entering my email id I am not getting otp .Dear Supercell team please solve my issue i have tried to contact but the message goes to a chatbot which only repeatedly ask the same question everytime.I have tried every solution you have mentioned in your site like checking spam box in gmail but no use I am pretty sure that I have entered same email adress which I have registered with Supercell.#SolveASAP,2
"After losing my interest in Clash of Clans a couple of years ago, I've finally rediscovered my love for the game. I highly recommend playing it, there is nothing else that comes close to this amazing gameplay.",5
