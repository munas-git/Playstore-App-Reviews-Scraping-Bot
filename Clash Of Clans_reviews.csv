"I used play this game back in the 2016. I started it again from strach a few days ago and so far loving it. So many necessary changes have been done by the developers which makes it even more fun to play. If you don't want to waste hours and hours of screen on time in a game then this game is the perfect solution for you. You just open it a few times in a day, collect your resources, build, fight and you are good to go. On the down side the upgrades can take a really long time.",4
"This is a perfect game if you got the patience and don't want to spend a lot of active time in it. Just log in, collect resources, do a couple of upgrades and battles and you are set. This doesn't mean that the game doesn't offer enough challenge and deepness. Between the multiple ways you can play and the constant updates, there are tons of hours of gameplay here. On the negative side, the upgrades get really long after the first few levels and there's lot pay content. Overall a great game.",4
The game is one of the best strategy games available on this platform. It has live events and regular maintenance io keep the game moving smoothly without any interference. Recently the game has introduced more rewarding tasks and they are worth achieving. But still there are some issues to be fixed and I hope that it will be solved.,4

"love ittt, but I swear to God there's this some kind of annoying thing that keeps on happening on the game. my wifi is very good but everytime I open the game it takes so much time for the game to load, before this doesn't happen but then now it takes over 10+ minutes to load until I can play the game! sometimes it doesn't even load it and I have to always keep on re-opening the game. my phone doesn't have any problems, it has alot of storage and never lagged. please fix this.",4
Good game overall. Fun gameplay as it allows creativity with attack strategies and base design. Planning the growth of your base is also a thing which is why it's really fun if you have a goal in mind. You can mess up by rushing your TH too much but you can still fix it little by little. You can spend money to speed things up but hard work is what pays off in this game. Kudos!,5
Great game! Alot of fun! The one downside is the long upgrade times as you get higher. Especially the eagle artillery. U need a max amount of gold just to upgrade and the first upgrade takes 9 days. That is a bit ridiculous for only being the first upgrade (lvl2). Everything else was way less when first upgrading. I don't have a problem with paying more for upgrading when things get higher levels. But a lower build time would be nice.,5
"Months ago, I was having trouble with the game because I was not able to play it since it crashes on the loading screen. But now, my respect has finally came back after a few changes, and I personally like the idea of making troop training absolutely FREE, as in FREE—now we have zero-cost at training our troops on three modes! (and this is getting better and better)",5
"I love this game. Even years after my last time playing, I was able to easily re-learn how to play. One thing I don't like is how hard it is to keep your loot because you only get 2 builders and then must grind up to 500 gems just to get 1 more. Plus, upgrades get really long after the first few levels so if that is combined with the difficulty to get more builders without paying money, it gets frustrating at times. Other than that, I love the game.",4
"Amazing game. Really the only thing I would like to see changed is the little blue ""i"" next to how many builders you have. It's excellent that it shows what is left to upgrade before your town hall is maxed out, but i wish it had more information and sorting options. Sort by price, TIME, or level. Just a thought. Also, Some of the stuff at the higher levels is kind of ridiculous for how long it takes to upgrade or research. 4 days for a potion? That's kind of crazy.",4
"I just returned playing the game, so im enjoying it, but the only problem is not the time to build and upgrade buildings, it's that the challenge feature, why does it need too much time just because i modified my base, i think the challenge mode is really good to try to understand and fix the defenses of your base, and know how to attack, or just have fun with ur friends. I think taking out the time duration or lower its time duration would be great.",4
"Clash of Clans has become a truly classic must-have mobile game. Having played the game on and off for eight years (since 2014), I still enjoy it. Progress slows down over time, but their battle passes have helped compensate for it with their end of season rewards (which are free). The game involves strategically planning out your base to protect your resources while building armies to defeat enemy villages. You can also connect to a Supercell ID to save your progress across devices.",5
The game that survived from 2013 until now. Since back then it's very different. The amount of popularity this game has is absolutely huge. It has the simple ways and styles to play the game. The reward system is good and very clean graphics. One thing I don't like are those bots spamming join>promotes(link)>leave and repeat. I wish you do something for that kind of problem. 5 stars. Keep up the good work. Happy Anniversary!,5
It's great you guys are continuing to update this game because it's is a great game. But I think you guys neglect the builder base. Nothing much has changed with it since it's release. Would love to have some type of daily challenges or something like that. Maybe even add in weekly challenges which are a little bit harder and monthly challenges which are hard to achieve.,4
"I am both a user on an Ipad but also on a chromebook. It seems that they have taken a liking to apple beter than google as I have no issues running it on my Ipad. I would love for this issue to be resolved as so I can enjoy it on both devices instead of just one. I have uninstalled it more than once, shut my chromebook down multiple times and have it updated to the most recent update and it has yet to turn on. Please adress this issue promptly.",2
"Super fun to play, and the things to do are practically endless! I can upgrade my base, attack someone, talk to clan members etc etc. And it's not hard to progress like some other building games, there's enough resources to let you upgrade super quick, but sometimes you have to wait to get some, so your always progressing, but not exactly zooming through the game. It's perfect!",4
"Great game! Playing it from the past 5 years! Only thing I'd say, add a button to clear all obstacles or trees and stuff, so that if i had one builder, I'll assign it to clear all, adding all the 10s-30s to give an estimate time and amount elixir required. I guess this would be much easier clear out the ground. It's very annoying to wait for the builder to finish one and then second and on and on with clicking each time to do it. Please consider this!",4
"Redownloaded it and got addicted by it. I completely still love the game until now! My only problem is the visual look of the heroes. I wish the heroes look changes as the level progress , just like old times. I also have this problem about clan war. I lost connection when I attacked on war, and after losing connection, I lost an attack. I didn't deploy and troops yet though. Pls add a feature where you wont lose an attack when this happens",4

"The game is challenging and fun, now that training troops are now free, but I recommend to lower the time duration even just a bit when building, upgrading or something because some of it even takes days, well it's not that bad. I think that's where the thrill starts though the. To he honest his games keeps getting better and better now, keep it up!",5
"Been playing on and off for the last few years. Very little has changed. Same characters, same stuff to do, but nice game to burn time. Only drawback is that it would be great if there were templates to use for base design instead of having to design your own. Really becomes a pain when you get over level 8.",5
"It's brilliant game. Addictive. Edit: I had leave playing game for sometime and uninstall it because it kept crashing and it became impossible for me to play game, or even enter the game. It kept crashing and few times it crashed between my war attacks. Please fix this problem. I really love this game and my progress in the game.",5
"I started playing this game in 2015 and had several maxed out accounts. It has been a surreal experience and it is a very enjoyable game especially with the new updates that have come. The only problems I've ever seen is sometimes it unfairly matches you with higher level opponents and the sheer amount of time it takes to upgrade buildings at a higher level. In my opinion , things such as gold, elixir and dark elixir collectorsarmy camps and other less important things should take less time",3
"I used to regularly play this game before the recent update. After the recent update, as soon as I open the app, it just shows a black screen and crashes on its own. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app a number of times, but it still shows a black screen and crashes on its own. Please let me know how to fix this issue. (Will update rating post receiving any response and if the issue is sorted)",1
I would've given it a 5☆ but it just cost so much to level things up it isn't funny![ unless you spend real $$ ] The amount of time something is upgrading for is ridiculous!! Also you don't get to pick and choose the players you attack in the builder base! I would say about 75% of the time when I get matched up to someone that's a higher level than me! Other than those things I really enjoy playing this game!!!,3
"This game is awesome. Really fun, I've been playing for years and I absolutely adore it, and it always keeps up with updates. The one and only reason I didn't rate this 5 star is the game makes it to where it seems like it wants you to stay in a certain league. I'm off and on with Titan 3 and Champion 1, I'm a townhall 11 attacking 12s, been attacking 1 up since th9, and I'll get attacked by 12s and 13s losing 30+ trophies. I'd rather attack th 11s for less avaliable trophies. Still a great game",4
"I really like this game, been playing since 2015 and it's never get old, although I stop playing it many times but it's easy to comeback💙💙💙 Suggestions! Nowadays it's hard to lot because sometimes when you are going to attack we spend so much time searching enemy base with good lots than the duration of your attack, maybe we can get some setting where you can filter your attack like you can set amount lot you want or town hall level.",5
"great free game! I've been playing off n on for 7 years and love a lot about the game, esp how they've continued to add new things to help with the insane upgrade times/costs. Though I love that they do that, I do wish things didnt take 3 weeks and max storage just for 1 upgrade(late game). Also the pathfinding n matchmaking have been top cons of this game since day 1. they say they've fixed it but its still just as bad unfortunately. I do really appreciate that you can play truly for free tho!",3
"I've played this a relatively small amount of time compared to lots of other people, and i'm currently th8. So far, the game seems great. It does have flaws like say the upgrades that take 24 hours and above, or the builder base which is just kind meh and i think a lot of players just forget about it. So far though, it seems great, besides getting up tiered by 2 levels, (which they should probably change) the game is good fun.",5
I have loved this game for years but I have had problems with the latest upgrade (June 2022). I tried to install upgrades for few weeks but it never worked. Today i tried again and was able to upgrade successfully. Unfortunately the game crashes every single time it loads. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling many times. I even tried my account on another phone but get the same issue. This means it is not a bug from my end. Please help to fix this! I paid money for this season challenge!!,2

"I love the game. The only problem is the time it takes to upgrade certain things. Plus, I don't know why they make the builder base so dry I think they should make challenges. To add, I really love the game I have been a fan for abour a few years but I think that maybe lower upgrade time and add more troops and town halls",5
"I downloaded the game a few months ago,because I missed it. I really love the new features new sceneries, challenges, skins for heroes, and also the magic items it really helps a lot in making my base upgrade much faster. My only concern is that there is no chat system between ""friends"" we can only communicate by adding them into our clan, but some of my friends hasn't built their clan castle. It's just annoying sometimes I hope y'all add some chat system for our ""friends"".Thank you.",4
"Its a great game at all, but I just wanna place this review as it seem that I'm not the only person encountering some sort of problem when logging in to the game. (Same as other) When I entered the game, it flashes the village I'm in, before kicking me a second later. I tried reopening the game, restarting my device and reinstalling the game, nothing happened and still has the same issue. I also tried opening the game on my second device and it also crashes. Wish this can be fixed very soon.",4
"I really like this game, been playing since 2015 and it's never get old, although I stop playing it many times but it's easy to comeback❤❤❤ Suggestions! Nowadays it's hard to lot because sometimes when you are going to attack we spend so much time searching enemy base with good lots than the duration of your attack, maybe we can get some setting where you can filter your attack like you can set amount lot you want or town hall level 15 😉😉😉",5
"love ittt, but I swear to God there's this some kind of annoying thing that keeps on happening on the game. my wifi is very good but everytime I open the game it takes so much time for the game to load, before this doesn't happen but then now it takes over 10+ minutes to load until I can play the game! sometimes it doesn't even load it and I have to always keep on re-opening the game. my phone doesn't have any problems, it has alot of storage and never lagged. please fix this. 1,190 people found",5
"The game is really good, the upgrades give good refreshing times for you to clear your head and attacks are really fun to plan out and execute. The only problem is that today, I got a glitch where all buildings are invisible and only show their silloette remain. It would be bearable if it didn't also happen with event bases. But overall, great game",4
"This is a very fun game and I really enjoy playing it! But the upgrade prices can be too high and also take to much time to finnish. This might be a way for us (the players) to waste more gems, and then buy more to use more money on the game and so, it raising a bigger amount of the same, but it bothers me quite a bit. If this could be changed to lower the prices just a bit I would put a 5 star review. No offence to the developers and again I really like the game.",4
"I really love the way the game is evolving and becoming interesting but, it could be better if we get something like High Graphcis. I mean, asking for a High Graphics for this kind of strategical game is a joke. But, I think we can get one. I really love the game and playing since 2016. Till now, we are introduced with various new updates which made the game interesting in a way but; the graphics are mostly the same kind. Though premium skins add a new flavour but, it could be better. I think!",5
"It's an awesome game I started playing 10 years ago when i was 15 but I have lost around 4-5 villages so far, it was impossible to recover them back then and there are other things that suck about it, but I totally recommend it, it's always changing and evolving, building times can be really long but you have several things to do in the meantime, although it is a pay-to-win game in a sense, as gems are found in small amounts and Macon out your village without them is extremely hard",4
It's a brilliant game and at this point it is a must have app. The only thing that I have problems with is making a second Supercell Id account on the same device. Making the first account with Supercell Id was extremely easy but the second account is where I find difficulty. I have through countless tutorials and still get it to work. I do not know if this is a bug or I'm just not following instructions correctly but I sure do hope you look in this and inform what the problem is. Thank you.,5
"A very satisfying game I can tell, that makes use of your free time rather than doing nothing. It's a good game that makes you interact with other players and lots of different challenges, it was fun tho, not until the national flags were being removed by its new update. But for me there's a lot to look about it, also the games overall quality is good so I'm giving it a 5 star rate.",5
"6 years now.... still play everyday! My friends and I use this for our group convo's and seeing how it needs, but DOESN'T REQUIRE, 5 min of daily maintenance and attention; it also helps to stay close/current with your family and friends you don't see often enough, in an interactive and exciting way. Rather than getting sucked into a social media app that is guaranteed to show you at least 1 thing that upsets you or saddens you. Plus they relentlessly add great new features. Thanks Supercell 👍",5
"Great game. It allows players of all levels to develop and continues to introduce new features after all these years. Quality of life updates have made the game have improved the game a lot. You can play the game without ever spending money, and you won't miss out on any functional aspects or features in the game. There are aesthetic features, such as premium skins (Costumes), and Scenery that can only be purchased with money, but it isn't necessary. Awesome game",5
"I absolutely loved this game from the moment it came out until now. I never thought you would be able to improve the game with each update,but you never disappoint. I love the change you made to the troop training. I see it only costs housing space to Train your troops. I would just like to see an option to qualify for the championships on the game",5
"It's brilliant game. Addictive. Edit: I had leave playing game for sometime and uninstall it because it kept crashing and it became impossible for me to play game, or even enter the game. It kept crashing and few times it crashed between my war attacks. Please fix this problem. I really love this game and my progress in the game...........?",5
"This game is amazing. No other words but amazing. BIG HOWEVER, there's a big con here, and that's the upgrading time. I've just upgraded my town hall, thus unlocked many upgrades, that take 11 D-A-Y-S to finish. I get that there's a system where the player should put real money into the game, and this game is also ad-free which is a major plus considering other mobile games, but when the price is ridiculous long waiting times, I'd rather watch someone playing connect 3 games for 15 seconds.",2
"it is probably one of the best games in the world but tgere is a problem that we cannot shift the network if gone bad, it goes for restart after changing the network immediately also and if i lost my connection in the middle suddenlyafter i upgrade any defenses or something it won't upgrade and we have to do it again.Besides,it is a very good game,we don't need to play it for 24 hrs,it is good for us,we can get fresh and very good attack system in ths game and good characters,i am obsessed with.",4
"Amazing game with a lot of updates and new content. The only problem is the progression system if you upgrade everyday, and stay online everyday to farm it will take you 7 year to max that means if you're 11 you will be max when your 18.(Keep in mind most ppl don't play everyday)But they add even more levels so it will take longer this and the 2 weeks upgrade times are a big problem that they still didn't fix it makes it so hard for people that don't spend money to go to the highest level.",4
"My favorite mobile game I've ever played. I've been playing on and off for, I don't even know how long. The fact that this and Clash Royale don't have ads is one of my favorite parts. You don't have to watch an ad to attack or boost resources. Over all 5/5. The only thing I'd change is that some people that upgrade, but don't play will get into the lower ranks and just sweep the floor with the other player. Other than that though, an extremely good game!",5
"It's very entertaining and even though the upgrades may take long it does make sense, you're not going to be finished playing within like 2 months as you are with many games, to reach a maxed account it takes like 5-10 years, it's very free to play friendly but you can also pay for things if you want to, and they definitely aren't overpriced. Just overall a great game with all the options there are",5
"Love the game, been playing it for years and starting over gradually, but the builder base is a real mess when you compare it to the Town base, when battling you have a high chance to be matched against a stronger opponent, Immediately indicating a loss, losses mean not getting rewards, not getting rewards means no upgradesz and no upgrades means not getting stronger, which leads back to losing. It's an annoying infinite loop which could use fixing, for that, 4 stars",4
"Best game I've ever played so far nice gameplay and the quality to,but as we all know not a single game has no problem. The issue is when attacking and accidentally press the home button and restart the game when you load back in,the troop when attacking is invisible including the siege machine other than the heroes. Pls fix this because this issue that I just mentioned is just a small one This problem has more bigger problem thx in advance supercell and well because its good Ill give the 5star",5
"Nice game, but the building upgrade is rather slow, so very fast I cannot do anything already, maybe can make it more faster and more option of the event so that the player can play longer. Also can add the speed button in the battle because the battle have to wait for soo long to finish, player cannot do anything else while waiting, so boring. If this things are fix I would give 5 stars.",4
"It's a great game that's fun to play with many, many, many things to upgrade and to do almost all the time (unless you're maxed) and the satisfaction you get from finishing an upgrade or getting a three star but during the later townhall levels those many things that seemed fun early game just sorta got lost. The upgrades take forever to do and you just get overwhelmed from the things you need to upgrade. Despite that you can still max out a base without spending money which is always a plus.",1
To the Devs: Decent game overall. Replayability could be a lot better. Multi-day upgrades and slow resource accumulation make the game easy to forget. That matchmaking is awful. You're either being attacked by someone far more advanced. Or you're completely destroying a base that is easily overpowered. Troops that live through the attack are used up. Why? The townspeople are useless. Make them a part of the game. There's not enough strategy. How about a world map?,3
"Obviously the GOAT of mobile games. A little boring at times when upgrades take long, but the variety of ways to play makes it easy to pick up and enjoy. One of the very few mobile games that is not PTW, as purchases only make the game quicker. With 2 bases of your own and several others that the clan owns, there's always something to upgrade. Wars are great, CWL rewards are super useful, Clan Games are both fun and rewarding, and the events are always worth undertaking. Supercell's work shows.",5
"Overall performance of the game and how you fix the bugs are great but there is something missing and that is the builder base update, i think it needs more improvement for the flexibility of the game and to have diverse strategies to attack. That is all and I hope you can see this",4
"I don't know what's happening, game crashing and instantly disconnected while attacking and when reopening its say error. Sometimes my attack is not counted on multiplayer in history attack, i feel bad for that got me 2x with high loot but i don't know what happen till my attack end, no loot can i get. But i love the game, i think its only a bug, please fix it.",5
"you can't NOT love this game, 10 years old and it's still going strong, we get enough updates to satisfy our thirst for content and the gameplay is super chill, a kind of game that you absolutely love but don't take too seriously all the time, you just attack and upgrade and check up on it once or twice a day to get more loot for more upgrades, year and a half in and im th11, the progression feels like it takes just the perfect amount of time (minus walls and heroes) and yeah, definitely worth",5
"I love this game, it never gets old. The graphics is outstanding and it is not a money win game, which make it fair to gamers who cannot pay. But my only problem is how long it will take to upgrade something, I just finished upgrading to th 12 and it looks like it will take me a year to max everything out, please developers, do something about it, but otherwise, it is a fantastic strategy game which is easy to learn.",4
"Yeah it's awesome the game works perfectly and it's fun with no ads or forced purchases. I rate 4/5 because there's one problem. The multiplayer battles are filled with way to many copy paste villages. I understand this is a player issue but it is still annoying to have to constantly skip the ""best base YouTube tutorial"" style villages.",4
"The game is really fun, graphics are good and sound are nice. You can do many things and play it every time. But I have some feedbacks for you:1. Builder huts are very expensive. I think it will be better if you give more gems in events or make builder hut cheaper. 2. Upgrading walls is really expensive. 3. It's not good at finding opponents for attaking. It usually find someone with higher level which you can not attack or gain 3 star and Sometimes it gives only 2 or 3 trophies for hard attack.",3
"I would suggest a good feature to coc. I felt there should be an option to copy the layout of other players and able to paste in our building arrangements. Some people may not be good at arranging the best way possible, this option can help them. Or even you can give an option where you can randomly arrange your base based on random template on a button click.",4
"I have tried a large variety of game till now , but I got board with them within 1 week. But COC is different ,if I take a look on its front... It looks simple and pretty easy to master but as you keep updating your town hall , you will find that 1 tile distance can change the whole game. It's like you are arranging a chess board ..... I think it's a perfect game where you use your IQ, tactics and madness all at a time.",5
"Dear Supercell, Today I have updated the game and then all of the sudden, my game freezes when logging in and then the app closes. I've tried to clear the cache and force stopping it. This game is truly amazing and I've been playing since 2014. Once the bug gets fixed, I'll surely turn my review to 5 stars. Sincerely, jace342",2
"My only complaint is when you are fighting online or single player, your troops go the opposite way of where you want to attack. I've lost battles this way. Everything else? A-OK. It's fun, challenging and a great way to kill time. I've rated it a 4 star because of the clean graphics.",4
"My only real negative gripe with the game currently is that I get spammed push-notifications that don't make sense. For example, it falsely tells me if my village is being raided (shield will be activated 15hrs lol), or, my troop upgrade is done, even though I've logged in since then.. Otherwise, it's a good game especially to connect virtually with friends. I prefer the older versions of the game because I thought it was harder, like troops costing. But it's a different game from 2015",4
"I've been playing this game for a little over six years now and I still enjoy playing once a day or every other for a few minutes. The reason I rate this a 4 star is because this game either involves a stupid load money to spend of upgrading everything or years of your life waiting patiently for things to finish upgrading, but if you have the time or the money I would recommend this strategy game.",4
"Clash of Clans is an amazing game, with great graphics and good quality. But, a couple of things aren't amazing. You can't actually control where your troops attack and how, and I hate the waiting time for builds, it means I login once upgrade and leave. I get that a waiting time is needed, but this means I have too much money and no way to waste it. I can't interact with clan mates and also can't attack . Because I don't need money. So play the game, and join the clan Kings Brethren. Good day!",5
"I've been playing this game off and on since arround 6 months after it's release, and I've really enjoyed it, and I got back into it recently and I've been enjoying it, but with these 2 or 3 most recent updates both my accounts have been bugged, I could attack a base 5 times same placement, same tactic and the pathing will never be the same, clan castle I can either have siege machine or troops?? You guys said you fixed it but you didn't. I truly can't hate the game though.",3
It is a nice game with op graphics and features. It got some cool characters and dragons. The game require brain to play bcz it need strategies to attack the enemy base. You can upgrade everything and change the background. Recently it add a pixel king skin and background . It was for free.,5
"This game is super fun and stuff. I enjoy playing it and it helps me relax. The problem--and the reason I wont give it 5 stars-- is that I HATE how we have to wait for our builders to finish building just so we could upgrade our walls or place them. Like what's the whole point?? The builders dont even go to the walls when we upgrade them. I think it's a waste because then we have to use our gems that take FOREVER to earn, just so we could HURRY up our process to upgrade walls.",4
Please fix the crashing issue many people seem to be having with the game as of late. Some are saying maybe the game is just no longer compatible with their phone but my phone is literally a gaming phone and I'm having an issue. 10 years is a long time to play a game that all of a sudden can't stop lagging or stay open long enough to play a full game! 😭😭😭,1
"Hi supercell, thanks for making this game super amazing over the years. Unlike some of your other games, this one hits hard with nostalgia and is easy to progress as an f2p, so good job on that. My only conplaint is the training cost removal, which removes the importance of resource management. Hope you can add it back",4
"It's a pretty chill game, you just farm stuff and get better troops and defenses. One problem,not about the game mechanics itself, is that after the very recent update where free troops have been introduced, The game doesn't start. It very slowly loads up, then shows the new update's banner, then it closes itself. please fix it soon develepors, I am waiting very impatiently to try out mass witches and yetis XD",5
"For me this is an awsome game. It is really fun and it's free for such a game that's fun. However I do have problem is that you can't attack more than once on the same base in regular clan wars because after the first attack and something goes wrong you instanly know what you did wrong, which is so frustrating because then you can fix that mixtake on one base. Which I know wouldn't really make sense if there are still a few bases left. But when its 1 base then it would. But it's still good game.",4
"I first downloaded CoC years ago on my 1stgen ipad mini. Recently. After 3 or 4 years of not playing i saw some updates dropping and decided to go back to it. My ipad still worked and clash was still downloaded. However, my ipad wasnt able to support the current version of clash, and therefore losing my TH9 base. However, the game has changed im ways i can easily see on my second run. Having gotten to TH9 again inna fraction of the time, and effortlessly saving up gems. Much better game today.",4
"Game is crashing frequently, probability of crashing when I open it is 9/10. When open the game, sometimes it crashes, sometimes it shows black screen, sometimes it just show my home base and I can't touch anything., sometimes it crashes when I click on war button, it even crashes when l click on news button, and the most chances of crashing is when I try to switch accounts, it's really very annoying that game is just crashing all the time. Please push an update as soon as possible.",2
"Base on my experience on how I play this, it was good and fun especially when the new update where the army training became free it helps me a lot saving elixir. I just want to have a suggestion the game is good but the upgrade time became longer and longer especially when you reach th 9+ it takes days to upgrade something . My suggestion is, make a new building, like clock tower or any building the give boost to builder to build fast the same as in builder base. That's all the game was so fun.",5
I am playing this game for more than 4 years. I've seen a lot of changes in this game during this period. But as the time passes this game is no more fun. The concept of clan capital and this update of zero cost for training army made me sick. This game is no more ambitious as early I try to get more loot in deploying minimum possible armies because of the cost to train them. But now its gone.,3
"I've been playing this game since 2015 ig, is a great one. The graphics are really well developed, the structure of how the game works is good and keeps you motivated to keep playing (without trying to make you buy anything, they have some stuff to buy with real money, but no pay-to-win). Thanks for the application supercell, keep up the good work",5
I m playing this game from 5 years. It is the best game i have ever played because it is not like freefire or bgmi in which we have to play for many hours to complete the missions. We have to just train the army and attack for the loot and just keep the buildings upgrading which i don't think so that it would take too much time.,5
"Fun and enjoyable. I have been playing this game since 2013 and it has been a fun and enjoyable experience through and through. You can play this game religiously, on and off, free to play or spend money and still have a great experience. The battle pass is definitely a great option to progress faster without spending too much money. I would love to see a little more community events in South Africa but all and all an amazing game and Dev team.",4
"If your looking for a good game for strategy and base development this is the game to get, yes it's takes a bit on moving up. Its all worth it in the end though, but the only flaw is how much the walls cost past town hall 9 so if y'all can change that many people will be happy because it just drains our money that's the only thing that I think should be changed. If y'all can reduce it by 50% or even 25% that will be fine. Thank you for making a good game and keep making it better",5
"The update was really awesome! No troop costs would really make us players experiment with our attacks! There is a little bug though. It's from the Capital raids where it shows how many attacks you have left, it keeps saying i have 5 attacks left even though i used up all my attacks. Not much of a big deal but it's kinda annoying if other players experience it aswell 👍👍👍.",5
"While I've been playing C.O.C. since it first came out in 2013, the only thing I don't like is the update that now the goblin attack portion has such amped up cannons against attack that even giants of level one are essentially taken out as quickly as barbarians. The damage effect and speed are the exact same. Otherwise, the game is still just as much fun now as when I first started.",4
"They Say Old Is Gold And They Well Say. An amazing classic strategy game. Only of the few games which is not focusing on selling passes and showing ads. Got obsessed with this game twice and left it but the game was powerful enough to allure me and bring me back for the third time. Supercell's idea of a Supercell ID is amazing and keeps the progress saved. I would just like to say supercell to that there is no need to make the game, ladder, farming and loot easy.",5
"The game is great and is one of my favorite, though I'm a bit disappointed because lately the game always crushes for I don't know what reason. When I open the app, it'll went well and then when I'm finally in the game, it stops and the screen will turn black and I'm back in my home screen. Why is it like this always? The first time it happened, I let it pass but lately it happens more often. I can't even play the game now, it always crushes. 😞 Kindly fix this please 🥺. Ty.",1
"Ive played this game since december 2014 and im still playing, this is the only game on a phone that i will never stop playing, i might have some breaks from time to time but i always come back and i dont mind the long grind from TH10 and up but the auto upgrade when you are gone for an extended period of time is annoying when you try to keep everything lvl1 and i think that should be an optional thing that you can togle, but i still give it 5 stars bc its my childhood",5
"It is a wonderful game but please remove that annoying upgrade time from everything. The cost collection itself is time taking and then we also have to wait for some days to finish those upgrades. Please supercell , remove this time system instead increase the cost of everything but please remove this annoying thing from the game. Overall the game is superb. Thanks.",3
"Great game, very good for wasting time on a boring weekend. My only request is that, for capital hill upgrades, that you add some sort of log so that you can tell who upgrades what and when they did it. It would be useful for organizational purposes, I believe!",4
"It's a great game and fun but I liked the graphics of the heroes better when they first updated their graphics because now they just totally look like cartoon characters. Don't get me wrong though, if you like to stratrgize to win a match then I recomend clash of clans because there is a whole lot of strategy that goes into this game. There are tempting offers in thd game that help your progress a little however it is possible to be totally free to play with some patients.",4
One of the best challenging game I have ever played. I recommend every one who wants to play a game for a long period they can install it. I m playing this game from the last 2 years and day by day its becomes much harder and interesting. At a start of game 10 seconds were enough for a single upgrade now I have to wait almost 15 days for a single upgrade. At the start it looks like a boring game tho but later on its becoming enjoyable and challenging..i will give 5 stars for it keep good work.,5
"Dev, please fix the issue when player face a network problem. For example like recent case of mine, attacking in war league, all doing fine troops were deployed then the wifi symbol popping out and when i relogging the game, there was no progress and the base remain at 0%. Before this whenever netwrok problem occured, the system like calculate the stuff and whenever u log back in the game there's progress. Looking for a fix in this matter sooner.",3
"I enjoy this game a lot, the battle system is done well, the UI is clear, and the matchmaking is good. Only problem i do have is the amount of tine everything takes, for example upgrades can take from a few minutes to days, if i would change anything it would definitely be the waiting times.",4
"This comes from a long time player coming back to the game in 6 years. It has changed and it is now much more complex but one thing never changed, the fact that if you don't pay attention to it for every moment of every day, you're getting raided, and whilst I understand it's part of the game, I would love for there to be a peaceful mode that didn't cost gems but I doubt that's going to happen so I propose this, an option to automatically refill your shield if you hat the gems available.",4
"This game is really amazing, It has gave me the feeling of something no game could give, overall it's one of the best existing games in the app store, the updates are amazing, the characters look good, especially the Archer, the upgrades may take a long time, but it's still one of the best games i've ever played.",5
"I've been playing the game since it came out. I never had any problem with the updates. But now with this update, where the troops need no elixir to get trained, I feel that the game is too dumbed down for a complete experience. I can understand that now players can upgrade troops with ease. But finding the best strategy for attacking each base with different troops combination while being elixir efficient and defending your resources were some huge parts of the game. Now that's all gone.",3
"Used to be good, latest update causes constant game crashes when loading some accounts. Have to delete and reinstall the game then switch to another account. If I try to switch to the bad account the game crashes then I have to reinstall and switch accounts again. Edit, they fixed it with a patch the next day but I'm not changing the rating. Should have put out the faulty update in the first place.",2
"Downloaded this app like three weeks ago and I never have any issues about it. I loved the game where I even spent money on it so i could keep up with my clan. I updated the app this morning and I just couldn't load the game anymore. Every time I open the app it crashes, goes black and just logs off. I restarted my phone and everything but nothing changes. Too bad that I already spent money on it and now i have to uninstall the app.",2
"I really love this game but in earlier days there are more problems when I open this game..Yeah that is black screen issue... Please fix this problem... And I search for it.. I realize that its affect the software...And it's only because of graphics.. When I touch each and every buttons like shop,settings, changing base design the screen is turned black and comes out of the game ,even when search for attack sceneries are big isssues while attacking.. I humble request you to fix that problem",3
"Exciting game,great graphics,addictive also,but whenever I start searching players in multi-player battle it cames at connection error (first),a few days ago I claimed gold but it did,nt come into my storage I ignored but tomorrow it was repeated (second),when any player attacked on my base the trophies are reduced but more than it was showing in my battle log(third)there are many more excuses but after all it is a great game so supercell it is very amazing creation but you have to maintain it.",4
"I like this strategy game, it's very challenging and very funny, but there is something that really annoys me when upgrading in the builder base, that is, the walls are too expensive, while the battle rewards are small, so it makes me dissatisfied because it takes a long time to upgrade all walls, I recommend that this be changed, thq.",4
"Why this is THE BEST mobile game I've ever played and I would recommend it 100% to everyone. It's, completely fun, sometimes challenging, great service if you lose your account, and no problems with the game! It also refreshes my mind everytime I play a little bit in my free time.",5
"This game is stunning. With the new update of clan capital, it became more interesting . I really enjoy playing this game but just a few months ago it started to crash. The moment I logged in it shows only black screen. I tried out several tips to solve the problem but still it's just the same so, I kindly request the developer to fix it.",5
"In this game you only have to check it once every day, or you can do battles and wars and etc. The only downside to this game is that at town hall 11 things start to go from minutes to complete to hours to days and then to weeks, it is a very long wait and the game has pay to win features for upgrading making it not fair for the free to play players. But overall good game I recommend this to people who play a little each day.",4
Been playing for 8 years or more I recently had an issue with crashing right after the game loaded. Messaged developers and with in 24 hrs the issue was solved. I've played other games and only get automated messages with no results. Thank you supercell for setting a standard and doing what you can to help your players.,5
The game is amazing. I really enjoy it but today when I was starting to upgrade my defenses. The game suddenly asked me to update it and after updating the game. I saw the troops in home Village can be trained for free now. This makes the game suddenly really easy and that's what I hate about it. I hate it because now the troops have no worth. You can use any troop you want for making raids really easy and I think this is wrong.,4
"Love the game. Full 5 stars. I have only one problem, now with the new summer update, i cant get into the game, it loads into the game and then shows the pop-up for the summer update that arrived, then the game kicks me out every time for some reason... Now i cant get all my rewards for reaching 4k points in clan games... Please fix",5
"I'm satisfied with the previous update. Although i do have a suggestion, though im not sure if it's already implemented but just in case it hasn't been, it would be great if you could add an offline timer to upgrades to notify us when an upgrade is finished even though we're offline, cuz as far as i can tell, you only get notifications for finished upgrades when you enable your wifi. And another thing, it'd be amazing if i can get multiple notifications throughout my accounts.",5
"It was the most wonderful game, I Ever played. I Like this game because of the good graphics, addictive and more....... So I like this game. I am waiting for the next updation of the game. THANK U for making this game.But I don't like the slow upgrade of the town hall and other things. And a another thing that we play multiplayer level we can loot the gold coins and resources of others, but we cannot loot their GEMS. Please fix the problem in the next updation of the game... 🙏🙏🙏🙏",4
"I really like this game. Its very addictive and play it all the time. I WOULD give it 5 stars BUT recently ive had an issue where, firstly it take 10 minutes to load, and secondly, whenever it finally loads it comes up with the ""bad internet connection"" symbol making it hard to play. I assure you that my internet is NOT bad.... its the game. Happy aniversary though!",3
"I wanna rate this 5stars but what i really hate the most is when i suddenly disconnected especially when attacking clan wars it doesn't reconnect. It was so frustrating that u cannot go back to the game and automatically lose those 3 stars. I hope it can improve soon, and and fix this issue in attacking.",4
"Very, very fun. The whole concept works so well. You can have fun with it how ever you want, whether thats trying to max out as quickly as you can, base desiging, trophy pushing, clan wars, clan games, builder base, clan capitol, etc. Always has and always will be one of the best mobile games of all time, I've never been bored playing it. First game I've ever cared enough about to review.",5
"One of the most stable and best graphic game. This game is perfect in its way. But apart from exciting gaming experience, one thing that i like the most about this game is that there is no rubbish and disturbing ads while playing it. Just smooth and very smooth!!",5
It was great until the last update came When I'm playing the game out of nowhere it kicks me out... happening multiple times a day... sometimes it doesn't finish up the loading from the opening screen even though my internet connection is ok... i also use mobile data for playing it but these problems exists. I use galaxy note 10 plus so i don't see any device issues here where I already play higher graphics requiring games. Please this game is something i love and care about. Fix it plz,4
"Enjoyable, the worst is to have an older tablet that didn't support new upgrade around the summer of 2022. Other then that it's more entertaining then barbies getting he man dressed in the morning. Or the newer games they have out that cost 50-60$ a pop. And yes you can buy gems and such to upgrade faster but with the monthly buy in of 4.99 or 5.99 is all you need and u don't even need that",5
"This game is fantastic! Everything is good and the events just spice up the experience! Except for one dangerous point that might get players lose their unsaved datas outside the game while playing, so basically when you use your phone which ram amount is below 3gb of ram will basically lagged the whole phone even crash the whole android system. (I hard reseted my phone for a lot time to clear up the ram and open the game without crashing)",3
"It's been completely broken for chromebook for around a year now, I've tried numerous ways to get it to work, all result in failure. When I open the game it shows me a dark screen then crashes, and after doing this a few times it gives me the: 'Clash of Clans has stopped responding' message. I haven't had any problems with this game on chromebook before it stopped working. Please fix this.",1
"June 2022 update CRASH.. CoC crashing since June Update App allowed me to make one Builder Base attack, then it froze and crashed. On restart it returns to Builder Base, freezes immediately and then crashes a few seconds later. I’m playing on an Android tablet. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times with the same result. Anyone else having similar issues or know how to fix it?",4
"The game is wonderful but in the builder base when ever I fight someone and I get a higher score then the other person it tells me that I lost and that I lose trophy when I'm supposed to be gaining trophy and it has done it on ever device I own. If you fix you it, I will give the game five stars, other than that the game is awesome.",4
"I will never leave Clash of Clans. This will always be my number 1 (mobile) game of all time. It has so many fun and engaging things to do, new updates regularly, and great graphics. But best of all, NO ADS! It has NO ADS throughout the entire game. And you dont have to pay a penny for it. That is something bold about this game and I absolutely love it. Keep up the great work, Supercell.",5
"Great game, TOTALLY free to play! You can spend money and upgrade faster, but not needed. Takes years to max, but fun. If you do want to upgrade faster, $5 for the monthly pass is the best money wise, but not needed if you don't mind more grind and time. NOT P2W",5
"Relatively fun game. Easy to play. And easy to accidentally sink all your time into if your not too careful. Perfectly capable of spending minimum time on if need be. Overall very flexible. Base building is probably my favorite part. I feel it adds a sort of tower defense feel to the game. And raiding other bases is nice when you wanna flip the script a bit. I've had the game for many years now, and the updates have yet to slow. They seem to make new content fairly often. Keeping things fresh.",4
"A great idle app to check on daily. I've been playing for about a year now, and it doesn't have any bugs or things that will interfere with the gameplay. On my specific phone (Android, Cloud Mobile) the game will restart and make me wait through the loading again anytime I pause the app and go onto another screen. This doesn't happen on my other devices. If you have a poor internet connection this game is impossible to play.",4
"It was a great game,but now it has lot of bugs. My entire game slowed down. It's taking 2-3min☹️ to find opponents in multiplayer battles. Please 🙏,fix this issue supercell, it's really effecting my enjoyability. Don't say I have poor connection, bcuz i am using wifi and I have cleared cache and also even uninstalled, and downloaded new game.",2
"Ok so, I've been playing this game for years and just after this recent update, its has broken the game for me. Everytime I try to play, itll get past the loading screen and as soon as it fully loads, it will show my village for about 2 seconds while frozen, then immediately crash. I know it's not just my phone because i usually play it using bluestacks on pc and it crashes on both.",3
"Best strategy and interesting game I've ever play the graphics is good especially the troops, I never play a strategy game before, untill Clash of Clans exists, but, the trophy system is not balanced, i push trophy for like 3 raid for only 11+, 22+, 15+ trophies, but when i got raided, got 30-, 29-, 36-, like, it don't worth for pushing the trophy anymore, please fix this? . That's all from me, thanks for the Enjoyable game!",4
"Been playing this game for nearly 8 years now, and during this time it has been a constant and remains a part of my daily routine. It's probably my favourite chill-out game. I've had to restart my progress a few times because of issues with google play (nothing to do with CoC btw) but I've never lost interest in the game. It was also kinda nice to refresh and restart. I think it's one of SuperCell's best games, and definitely a favourite of mine. Here's to another 8+ years! 😊",5
"Supercell, ive been playing this game and progressed from townhall 5 to now, 10. And everything was going smooth, until the last update. The last update was good but it affected the performance. The game was laggy when i swipe the screen. It was so laggy, that i couldnt really enjoy it, not like before. I have 3gb of ram left. I tried restarting my phone, clearing cache and it didnt work. Please fix this issue. My device is oppo m3 pro. The ""lag"" Doesnt happen to any else of my games.",3
"Been playing for few years, but I stopped but some reason I forgor. After coming back for 3.6 years, I can say it's still a fun game, the auto upgrades is very cool and helpful and the little coming back tutorial is excellent, keep it up! 👍",5
"When i try to open the game it takes so much time to open. Also sometimes it does not even open the screen just freezes and it kicks me out. Storage is not a problem I have plenty and its the only app that does this. Despite all this which I hope you can fix, its my favourite game.",2
This game is very cool but i disappointed because when you upgrade the opponents and troops it have a long time to finished the upgrade and level up the opponents and also when you upgrade all thing in the game it has too much pricey. but the game is very okey for me that's why i rate it 5 stars . i hope that you will fix alot of things in the game,5
Super fun game. Word of advice: save all your gems for builders huts so you can build/upgrade multiple things at a time! I have fun as co leader in Our clan going to war twice a week. Lots of events come up and it feels like there's more to get excited about everyday . The versus battles are super fun too and really provides unlimited play . Love this game,5
"The only thing that annoys me a little bit is that some players have the number of trophies that I have, and so they have 11 level Baracks when I have only level 5!? That thing was very weird. Well, this game is very satisfying many times, it trains your patience and makes feel you like a great commander. I recommend it to you!",4
"While it's fun to play when waiting around wasting time, the upgrade cost & time is becoming more and more ludicrous as I keep progressing (mind you, I'm a near maxed Town Hall 12). Maybe the prices aren't terrible, but certainly the timing to upgrade is getting obnoxiously long. Higher in the ranks (Titan III), gets annoying when trophy pushing, most of who you're matched with is either too low in trophies but maxed Town Hall 13 or too high while being two town halls ahead of me & nearly maxed.",3
This game is super nostalgic for those who used to play this a long ago. I am also involved in those people. It's been 3 years since i played this last time. Now i am seriously suffering from nostalgia. As a matter of fact i left this game because of its time... I mean in old days the buildings took too long time to be upgraded and that was irritating. But now supercell has given ear to our requests and decreased the times... So now i can make my base adorable... Thank you for reading..❤,5
"This game keeps on crashing again and again. I'm unable to do a single thing!🥴 I don't know why is this happening, because my phone matches all the requirements you have mentioned. My device is Android version 11 and 3GB ram, I know the ram might be a reason for that. But please, if you can then please help me. Or get a new option by which I can reduce my graphics 🙏.",1
"Love this game but ever since the last update, it's been crashing all of the time. Especially on raid weekends. It crashes and eats my attacks. It crashes and I lose my base edits. It crashes when I try to donate Capital gold. It's really frustrating.",3
"I have a problem. Always when I entered into the game the screen gets black and where there is troops and building, there is blank. Do something,please. There is some problem in my game. When I command to update something, the game sofwear didn't take the command. Last I try to update the labrotory, but it didn't work. 😢😢😢😢",1
The game is really good and fun. However I have one problem this game can take way to long to complete. Just as a example I'm town hall 11 and it can take 5 days for me to upgrade my Archer queen however I can not use my Archer queen whilst upgrading. It would be really nice if I could use her or the upgrades for hero's are instant.,4
"Upgrading things at the end takes soooo long for no reason other than to make you spend money. I have been playing this game for 4-5 months straight after not playing it for 10 years, have max town hall, and upgrades take on average 15 -30 days to complete now. Can't get anything done anymore because of these long waits. It is a terrible mechanic designed to make you spend money to speed up the process and I am ashamed to have fallen for it. I'm fed up with it and uninstalling this for good.",1
It's a very interesting game. I am playing it from 2 years . Everything is good but I would recommend that after th 9 or above the timing to upgrade anything should be less beacuse it take too much time to upgrade anything and sometimes it becomes boring.So please settle it,4
I love this game I've been playing it for ten years. TEN YEARS!!! I've never played a game for that long it's a slow process if you're a busy person it's a good game cause the build times take long and som3times it feels unfair cause you will get attacked unless you don't attack which I recommend if you upgrade now here's the deal do the Google play n save it will save your progress which you don't want to lose cause this game takes a long time. This games fun when you get ahead at th 6+,5
"The game is overall good. I face only 2 issues. One is that the builder is very expensive to get and it's price increases with no. of builders you have. Second, the limit on builds is to much. Edit - i want to suggest that there should be a scheduler for builders. For example at a specific time 3 of my builders should start upgrading the heroes and after that they build something else in the next 24 hrs.",4
Really amazing app honestly. I definitely recommend this app. The only bad side is how long it takes to upgrade things. It could take even up to weeks. But other than that it's amazing. A really good about this app that you can get creative with your base building.,4
"Constantly crashing to black screen (with sound) on start up, and when switching from Home Village to Builders Base, attacking, etc. Not sure what's causing it, have uninstalled/reinstalled more than 3 times, still happening, cheers.",3
"The game is a classic. But idk why I need to clear my cache to make it not lag but if that was fixed then it would be 5*. It's literally unplayable when it lags. Like 0-5 fps when it lags. And not just for the moment but when I go back to my village, go to clan mates village, go to my builder village, go to the capital, attack in the capital war and just basically doing anything. Maybe this phone is trash but it shouldn't be the phones fault cause it doesn't lag in any other game I play. :(",3
"The game is awesome. But supercell please fix the bug. When I was entered the game ,the game was opened for few seconds then the screen became black . So I can't play this game. Please supercell fix the bug problem at an early.",5
One of the few games I have kept over time but this game more or less turns into a farm simulator where you pray someone doesn't 3 star you because they used Pekkas or dragons as they tend to demolish everything and not to mention that everything is super costly to upgrade and I'm not even going to mention the DAYS it takes just to upgrade a couple of buildings (yes some buildings will take an actual day to be done while it is also unable to help defend) also i don't like global chat being gone.,4
Bad Connection issues. I've had multiple instances now that the game just randomly disconnects from my wifi even though it works perfectly fine. It's cost me clan war victories and it's starting to get old. please fix the servers or what ever is causing this.,2
This is one of the best games I have played in my life but pls work on the ai of the battle machine and sneaky Archer and also the bomber coz it is so irritating when they go only for the walls. Also pls add Sparky to clan capital and also it would be nice if you could add a new feature which would allow you to assign more than one builder on one single upgrade or construction to speed up the process.,4
"The game is great, but for the last week and a half, I'll be in the middle of a battle and I'll get a ""connection lost"" message and the game will restart. I lose the battles when this happens and as a result, I lose trophies. I've lost almost 1,000 trophies because of this. Please fix it.",2
"Love the game but it just wants to crash randomly, especially when I'm in the middle of a battle . Game still keeps crashing in the middle of a battle, causing me to loose, extremely frustrating.",2
"Very nice and stratigical game, I really love the game and have been playing it since 2020, Well this is a wierd complain I know but I kinda liked when the troops costed elixir. It makes the game way simpler when the troops or spells don't cost anything but sometimes u don't have anything to spend elixir on so, I would really appreciate if the feature is back",4
"Starting yesterday when I tried to open my clash of clans. It says Downloading Content it takes so much time but in the it pops up saying Connection Lost and it keeps happening again and again and again. I don't know if this has something to do with my internet because our internet connection is good I tested it on opening other apps and speed tests and it works fine so I think the problem is mainly the coc app not my phone, nor our internet connection. Please Fix this problem",1
"Amazing game all around! Every new update spot on, making the game more fun, each time. This game has a very small amount of flaws, with a countless amount of redeeming quality’s! I’ve been playing this game for 4 years on the span of 4 different accounts.",5
"By the adventurous game i played it for over 3yrs,every games needs improvement and this game highly recommended,Pros,Smooth no lacks,time consuming process and actions also take place so all in all yes good ,Cons,improve its graphics,and mainly focus on its game structure""Town hall""so the players keeps moving",4
"Great and fun game you can upgrade you troops and base. You can attack other players bases and evolve into a great base. You level up and get millions of coins which you can use to buy traps , defense's, things for your army, and ect. Overall great game love to play try it out!!!",5
"I am facing a problem specifically with COC after I updated my phone to Android 12 (realme UI 3.0) due to presence of features like farmers and assistive ball in my phone, which keep on poping up which should only happen once a game starts. This thing as I observed was not happening while playing other games on my device.",3
"June 2022..constant crashes!! After playing since 2015 (7 years) with no problems.The recent late June 2022 upgrade,the app just crashes after the supercell splash screen appears and the game launches then freezes and quits. Uninstall and reinstall does not remedy. The game cannot now be played at all.Clearly a glitch that needs rectifying. As I now cannot play ,no doubt I'll lose trophies,ranking and loot.",1
"I love this game, I've been playing it for many years and it's overly addicting. After the last balance update the game has started stuttering (newer model phone) so it's four stars until then. I still honestly love this game and will continue to play it, the community is seriously special. Edit: stopped stuttering shortly, everything else still stands",5
I've been having a problem with the entire game. When you open up the game it turns my music off wich is pretty annoying and in no longer let's me screen recording when I'm trying to make a video. I know it's not a big deal so it would be unfair to take a star away but since it's such a good game I'll leave it at 5 stars. Please fix this problem.,5
". PLAY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!/// 7+ year 62 y.o. player. TWO maxed out accounts less Capital Peak. The first statement and last sentence are from my previous review. You made the superheroes much more doable⭐⭐⭐. I have some apprehensions re. the newest changes but so far-so good. Capital Peak is good, but is it enduring? The last sentence is still true. But with troops so cheap, just burning them doesn't hurt 🤔. When u don't use all of troops in an attack, it messes up the incoming lineup.",5
The same problem occuring with the game again it still just shows loading but does not start and vanishes the screen due to which it takes a much longer time to perform any task and they are not fixing this problem which makes game worst and demotivate to play... The clash royals is much better than this..u all are just pretending but not fixing the minor bugs and just giving rubbish upgrades..,1
"The game is AWESOME, love the clan capital and the raids medals we get. The game is fun and non addicting but one huge problem that face- the game rarely loads. I try to open the game, the loading screen shows and the bar goes full, but then the screen just goes black. This repeatedly happens and became tired of it so I had to uninstall the game. Hope you fix this issue so I can play the game again",1
"The game is a masterpiece, i have been playing it for years, but could never have thought that I have to give such a bad review. Every time i open the app it loads and then the screen goes black, the game and audio runs in background but the screen get black,sometimes green. It's become extremely hard to play the game, because it rarely opens. And even if it opens it sometimes crashes during wars . I request the developer to look into the matter at the earliest.pls do, as it's defiling the game.",1
"Awesome, cool graphics and very addictive. Best game I have ever played and it doesnt consume data. I so much love this game. The characters. The only problem I have with the game is the time it takes to upgrade buildings when you get to a particular town hall. The suspense of trying it out is really much.",4
Still pay to win.The new update really has nothing to offer the season passes are repetitive. Tbf it's just 2 grindy its take a lot of time and in the end u pretty much just wasting your time. There is definitely some incentive to buy the pass with all the ads surrounding it.I liked it yrs ago but it's really no change more like some tweaks. Cash grab game,1
"I've used tonplay this game along when it first came out. Was such a cool game, and even though I was comfortable spending £20 per month to buy in app purchases, the overall enjoyment was worth the cost. However, since it became an insanely expensive game to play, so unless to pay to play to win, you simply can not keep up with the updates and new gear needed to stay current. This used to be a 5 star game, these days I give it 2 stars purely because of how focused it is wealthy players",2
Pretty fun so far. Downside is the upgrade times get really long the further you get in. I also wish there was an option to watch ads to earn gems. Some things are confusing as they give you a new village with no explanation after fixing the boat.,4
"Game doesn't motivate you to play much, especially lategame. Upgrade times can go up to weeks, so even if you farm there's no point. Shields last from morning until evening, then for whatever reason you don't get attacked at all until about an hour before you log in. My thrifty personality doesn't exactly allow me to break/reduce the shield that I got, so in the end I only log in, collect resources and log out. Armies also take forever to train, so I can only do 1 or 2 attacks at a time at most.",3
"Game is fine, and entertaining, But when your clan gets invaded and wipes out the town every single time, Thereby wiping out any progress you made, it quickly gets old and boring. Especially when I destroy someone's town and get was less trophies than the same person attacking me. Makes everything I just did for the last 3 hours moot.",1
"Still fun to play after all of these years. Some of the quality of life changes are really helpful. Still needs bug fixes, the troop AIs (looking at you, Battle Machine) is kind of broken in some instances.",5
"Missing out on scenery sales and other stuff (including the 10th Clashiversary) is just crushing. These thing never come back either. FOMO is so heavily relied on, it's disheartening when you actually miss out. (Also, screw you for just giving the Pixel King away for free and demanding the other heroes be purchased. Predatory. ""First hit is free"" nonsense. ""Don't you want to comolete the set?"") I personally have had enough missing out and I no longer wish to play.",3
"Great game, but it takes too much time to upgrade heroes late game. Taking 5+ days to upgrade a hero each time is too much, so if you want to upgrade them by 10 levels, you'll be done after 2 months, which is absurd.",4
The game is great & quite balance. I have a lil bit of a problem with the notifications when I used a builder potion my notifications didn't went off & I'm sure of it because I have a personal ringtone that is very loud & clear so I feel like I didn't get 100% benefit of the builder potion I have used so I hope soon fix the problem that I am having.,4
"No game comes near this game. After tried a lot of games, I came to conclusion that this is out of this world game. The concept about elements and structure of the game is amazing. I don't have any shortcomings about this game. This game has all, it becomes your home, your family, you get emotionally attached to this game. You can progress, you can play with friends in a lot of ways etc. Amazing, just supercell keep sending it forward!",5
"The Game itself is good .The problem starts for the free2play group,this game takes years to max out and if u dont buy at least season pass then taking 3-4yrs i dont understand the need for 17-18d upgrades,like its a game after all and if u just wanna do a 2d upgrade, it can take 300 gems even though gems are very very hard to come by and resources are expensive as hell I would love to see an update decreasing time for upgrades and increasing magic items in free season pass and more free gems",2
"Classic phone game. The best from back in the day. Just started a new account after about 3 years i was like th9 working on walls. Fun to start all over after a long break. Seems to be a little more micro-transactions, hopefully nothing game breaking. 5 stars for now Edit this isn't my clash of clans. It's like they kept trying to balance things with more things. what a mess. You got like 3 villages now, how bout a forth with classic clash th10 max less crazy critters. 1 star til I get a reply",1
I enjoy the game too much in everytime I do my recreational things. I like clan wars and so much battles to suppress although I often to acquire a loss. I hope the company are more willing to improve regarding the designs towards the progress of the game that the players may satisfy to their own bondings with a few lessons may learn as well. Goodluck and do your job better at all time!!!💓,5
"Update...same as before: (hard to win on defense no matter what you do). The game has very good quality graphics, variety of troops, and events. Although, if you're looking to spend, then you might find some equal justice in troop upgrades. Just keeping it real for you 🧐! P.S. My village was recently attacked and none of my heroes were present to defend ( I took screenshots 😱 ).Therefore, check your replays!",2
Please do something about the network error.During the beginning of war attack a wifi symbol is appearing even though no problem with my internet. The wifi symbol is only disappearing after game is restarted and all progress in the war is lost.Even if we lost our data connection for half second whole attack is failed. Please do something about it.,1
"Might be the best mobile game to waste your time. It's fun and you have to use your brain to play, it isn't mindless. Base designing and attacking are all well put together. Nothing seems OP so far. I don't know how it will continue on, but the game right now ia great!",5
There has been a game breaking glitch lately where the game crashes the entire phone needing a hard restart. It triggers during the loading screen and it just almost always render my phone unusable. Please fix this bug because it really is infuriating for this to happen often,2
"This game is really great, but the upgrade time is just ridiculous, and the cost to. I know it's an important building but why does it cost so much. Hope you can improve this. Then maybe more people would join this game. Besides the cost of upgrades and the time, it's really a great game!",3
Amazing top notch game I cannot believe a game like this looks so amazing I've only got like 8 hours in and it's really fun I can see the strategy and I love how the game gives you a three day shield so you can advance in time but it also lets you go guns and glory with cancle shield or attack to shorten shield. The rank system is amazing and the gameplay is to five stars because I cannot believe this game has come so far,5
The game itself is a really cool game but there is one thing that supercell should fix is if your 3 to 4 times stronger than the person you're attacking you shouldn't be allowed to attack there should be levels because I keep getting attacked by people that are literally three to four times stronger than I am and that shouldn't be allowed at all,4
"This is a great game, but it keeps on having errors of client and server are out of sync whenever I attack, and I'm constantly losing trophies because of this. Please fix!",3
Why do town Hall bases that are above me by 1 or 2 getting 30 or so trophies for clapping my base but when I get matched with a TH base the same as mine or lower the trophy yield is no bigger than 15? How does that make any sense? Literally giving them free trophies from my base but I can't get matched with a base that I can hit properly? It makes no sense I'm literally a farm and I can't hit any base because they're way too difficult or over levelled.,2
"Literally paying money to get special time sensitive item boosts, and the game has kicked me out 7 times today and blocked out literal hours of game play and it just ""happens"" every time I'm using items I paid for. No gem refunds, no item refunds, just took my money and blocked me from being able to play and use what I paid for. Not to mention not being able to play on my breaks when I actually had time to. Support never cares about you. Save your money and time, don't play this game.",1
This is an amazing game I only wish I could be beta tester other than that I love this game I had to restart over and over before there was supercell I'd but I still love it zero training cost is amazing to it makes it alot easier to upgrade my troops I have no complaints . In my opinion there is no mobile game. It's all so balanced I'm very happy that someone created a truly non pay to win the only things you pay for is gems which you can get from achievements and skins for scenery and heros.👏,5
"The latest update broke my th9.. everytime I try logging into it, the game crashes and I have to clear all data to get the app to work again, but my 1 th9 everytime I log in it's on the builder base and it freezes. Contacted support in game and they keep telling me I'm in the wrong topic/category. I'll definitely add the last 2 stars once I get some help with this. In the meantime I'm pretty bummed out tbh",3
"I loved this game very much .Explore the dungeon, collect crazy weapons, dodge bullets and shoot‘em all up! “In a time of gun and sword, the magical stone that maintains the balance of the world is stolen by high-tech aliens. The world is hanging on a thin thread. It all depends on you retrieving the magical stone…” We honestly can’t keep making it all up. Let’s just shoot some alien minions! This is the game you have always wanted in your subconscious. Explore the dungeon, collect crazy wea",5
My game keeps crashing when i switch accounts specially while visiting the night base. In home village it has no problem but in night base the game keeps crashing after this update. Need to fix this asap because once I visit night base it crashes and I restart the game and it opens in the same night base and crashes again and doesnt let me do anything.,4
"Okay I give this a 3 in hopes of getting the attention of someone that can help me! After the update, everytime I try to open the game, it flashes an add, then immediately crashes. Ive restarted my computer, uninstalled, reinstalled the app...Please fix ASAP Im addicted to this game! Its a great game, when you can play it!",3
"Pretty good, less pay-to-win than most games of its type, though it is much faster to spend money. Prices to buy packs are typically low, however gems are quite a bit. Great game to play, loads of fun and hardly any lag, despite being able to play with people from the other side of the world. ¹⁰/¹⁰",5
"This is now the game I play quite often. It doesnt need a lot of attention; you just need to upgrade things every now and then. I am now town hall seven and I am pleased at how the game is slowly getting better and better. But when the free troops and potions update came out, it made it too easy. Not that I'm complaining, but now you can just get really expensive troops for free, which doesnt really help the lower town halls, yet give the upper town halls an advantage. So try it out. It's great.",5
"Been playing for 8 years now and still a daily ritual. The game is updated 3-4times a year with either new building or troop levels, balancing changes or new features such as the Clan Capital that's embraces working as a team. It used to be a right slog to get things upgraded but now with the season challenges, clan games, clan war league, shop etc, getting your village and troops etc maxed out are no longer a chore. A true, free to play (if you want) ad free game that combines strategy and fun.",5
so annoying! when searching for opponents they will appear above 2 level on your level.and if your city was defeated you will lost 30 points but when you attacked others citys it will give you +7 trpohies😂..can you make a fair searching not for trophies but by level.if only i can give this games with -5 stars i will.,1
"Great game, just a couple scuffs here and there. Every time i try to download this game i have broken texture. First time it was all flying units. 2nd time was all towers excluding my barb king. 3rd time my hog riders became invisible and i couldnt tell when to use my heal spells as there was no way to see how many there were in one area. Pls help! Alright nvm i got help from someone else who had the same problem and got it fixed in the end :) 5 stars for you!",5
Solid clan based farming game. multiple ways of playing with in game season pass and other ways to speed progress but not necessarily needed. Can make multiple profiles with different email accounts not the worst option having 2 to be able to gain more troops. Not for everyone but stood the test of time,5
"It's an amazing game with great detail and it's really fun too! There's so many different troops and buildings u can get, but the reason I've rated it three stars is because once you get far in the game, you have to just go in the app, upgrade some stuff, launch two attacks, then there's nothing else to do so you have to wait till tomorrow to do the same thing again",3
"The game is super cool. the game is fun, non addictive game. I had playing this game since so many year but recent one update came and I can't update it, it will go to 100% after that it again starts from 0% no network issue or storage issue. while playing this game if anyone calls me the game gets lag in other games there is no issue. iam extremely disappointed from this problem please fix it as soon as possible",3
A great base building game with plenty of challenges and achievements. Great PVP system too. A great game to sit down and play or to play for hours or on the fly. Also has a very good multi-player system for gaming with friends.,5
"My app's crashing the whole time. I've reinstalled it and it's still crashing. After a few times of reinstalling it, it directs me to play store instead of my home screen. Usually when a game directs a user to playstore, it means there's an available update but there are no updates available. Please fix this as soon as possible.",1
"Latest update with capital was huge, really huge, maybe bigger than what was needed, sending single gamers back to the start. I am playing it for years and 5 stars is still the score this game deserves. But I think I'll stop here. Thanks for all those nice gaming years. A rare game where you don't need to pay to enjoy and still be in equal terms with those paying.",5
"Amazing game, so entertaining and so fun, clash of clans is really just too good for the play store and everyone is lucky that it doesnt cost money, one thing i live about the game is that it uses barley any data and has no ads! If your reafing this and you don't have it installed get it it will change everything! <3",5
"Fun game, but I absolutely hate waiting for the opponent to finish attacking me after I've attacked him to see who has the better attack (builder base). I know their attack isn't live, so why am I forced to wait for it to finish? Edit - I give up playing the builder base. Nearly ever single attack I have to wait on a replay of that person attacking my base before I attack again. Stupid and pointless. Edit - Dropping to one ⭐ because the developer refuses to address pointless waiting on attacks",1
"game is boring just because of 5 builders and upgrading time was 7 days, 10 days thats the disgusting, and the while attacking game lost the network manytime, since a week i cant even open game just because of connevtion, but my internet working fine, no issue with other apps and game, this happened just to the clash of clane, i request you to reduce time of upgrading buildings, and troops, otherwise, you guys loosing the players.,",1
"removing national flags? really?? I would've expected supercell to add more countries to the lineup. not only is this less fun, but some of us have needed to reformat our bases or decorative setups to comply with having our decorations forcably removed. I don't care if we had our money 1000x refunded, it wouldn't have been worth the negative aspect of wishing I had my old layout of decorations back. I love this feature, & I included many flags I'm fond of. I'm disappointed & surprised by this.",2
I don't understand why the battle machine is do dumb. If i use a wall breaker for troops to go inside the battle machine will start clearing the outside buildings which is not even on the way even when that side is cleared it will go to other side but bot go inside. Sometimes it is so confused about what to do that it will go toward one building and suddenly change its direction.,4
"This game is very interesting & tricky. It is very good. But I have rated 4 🌟 in 5 🌟 as I have been confronting the black screen so many times. For this cause I have lost many good chances to win battles as a veteran & an invincible player. So, I request the developer of this game to fix this problem by an update. I am suffering in it since the update of clan capital.",4
"Ok I've played for years and had issues they still haven't fixed but the one that pissed me off most is the fact after you disconnect from a multiplayer attack it still goes, yeah that's fine and all but CLAN WAR it just ends the attack like bro I literally disconnected for 1 second like bro make your game better.",1
"Great game, especially now that they have reduced build times. Highly addictive, I wish there were more games like it! Great features, great gameplay and great graphics. The strategy elements are surprisingly deep which i love. This is my favourite mobile game, and it has been for years. LOVE IT!",5
Such an addictive game. I have gotten far in the game but does take a while to do upgrades the higher you go up. Some take up to 10 days or maybe more. I check the game about twice a day and that's perfect for me. But very enjoyable. Would recommend for people who stick to their games,5
Pretty fun game but you have to wait like hours for just one upgrade. And you can't really do a lot until your warriors are done and it takes a while if you are trying to get one that needs minutes to be trained. But this is a very addictive game.,4
The Game is fun and awesome to play. But one annoying bug that is ruining my experience is that anytime I go to type my keyboard wont pop up. It's very frustrating. Especially when I need to communicate with my squad. For that I will not rate this game any hire. Please fix this.,2
This game is amazing. I have been playing this game for a long time and I have always enjoyed it. I love how this game takes progression to get to a higher level. It just gets you eager to play! Everything about the troops and upgrades are all Ballanced. This game has to be the best progression/attack strategy game! The ambience is also outstanding. I also love how this game continues to have updates and new features! It's also great how it's not just one base but three. I recommend to try this!,5
"Great Game! Except after new update the game will crash and close upon opening it. I've tried reinstalling, wiping game data, and restarting my device. Not sure if anyone else is having the problem, but I hope it will be fixed in a future update.",2
"Hello Supercell,again I want to say you that COC is the most awesome and interesting game I have ever played. But from few days ago my game is just crashing like anything, when I open the game it crashes, when I end a multiplayer battle and come to my village it again crashes. Not only in home village but also in the builder base it crashes all the time. So, please fix these problem. I am a TH 12 player and not want to give up playing.",1
"I love this game so much, I've had it for years. But for quite some time I haven't been able to get onto the game because it crashes before its done loading. Pretty Frustrating because it has been my favorite game for a long time and really loved the people you meet playing it. But it's unplayable at the moment and hope it can be fixed",5
"Game won't load after last update and it won't let me log into my Supercell account. They never send me an email to verify. Maybe it's for the better. Taking 3 days to upgrade troops and equipment is enough, but 9 days!!! I get it, buy gems, pay to play. The costs quickly outweigh the benefits and can easily climb to hundreds of dollars...or you wait for over a week for one item to update.",1
The new game mechanics having to train troops without spending elixir is such a game changer. Now I don't have to worry about the resources for training troops. Instead I can now focus more on the upgrading side. Love the update hope you keep it that way. It really helps a lot in strengthening my village.,5
"Its kind of fun but you would expect the matchmaking on a game thats been out this long to be good. It is horrible, im placed against people with buildings and defenses I havent unlocked or built myself. Its impossible to compete like that. Ive played this style of game all my life but somehow have lost more than 2 dozen matches in a row. Horrible beginning experience. I just uninstalled.",2
"I don't play very often, haven't in a few years, but everytime I come back there is game play changes which is good. They just keep adding more ways to gain revenue and the time it takes to get loot and upgrades is still long.",4
"Awesome game playing since the start if this game and taked a brake for about 2 to 3 years and restarted. I dont have any complaints. Just one request, its hard to predict the way of the siege machine when it is deployed so i kindly request to add some requirement to know the way of siege machine when it is going to deploy.",5
"It's good game, graphics is great and the gameplay is so beautiful,the settings is good too but I encountered a bug or glitch that I found a base to attack and I get 3 stars but after that ends I got back in my base and the loot u took from that base is gone and I panic and check the attack history/log and it's not there as if that attack never happen,plz fix this glitch or bug all the effort of searching and the money I spent to search that base just to get nothing,fix it plz",2
Hey supercell you should change the setting of upgrade and skip the timer of upgrade of any building rather than walls and you should initiate the instant upgrde for every building just like walls as the building level get higher it's upgrade time is increased because it is taking so much time to max any town hall. Thank you and i request you to do the above and you should reduce the upgrde cost of higher town hall building.😊 And your game is very good and i am enjoying itsorequesttodotheabove,5
This is a good game for those that love to show how good they are at strategizing they're attacks and defenses. May take a little bit to adjust to upgrades that are only a week long once you reach TH 10+. It isn't even a pay to win kind of game for most people. I would recommend that you share this with your friends. 👍,5
"Lost the community feeling ,no meanful upgrades in main clash game only every 18 months, the balancing act only degrades the good troops and the de , becoming stagnant. Only the odd time give us info and more into worlds and not paying enough attention into the reason they started this game 10 years ago,Losing touch with what the players need and could use better management of the game . Clash on",2
"The game is good but the app shows problems from time to time, it does not start, or gets stuck in the loading screen, or closes suddenly, freezes etc. I have tried using it in multiple devices, but still shows the same problems.",3
The game gets boring after awhile especially when there are updates every 3-4 months. Maybe there should be small update every month and a big update every 4 months. Just so the game stays fresh. Also it doesn't help when all the updates have been adding stuff for the higher town halls only. Only major thing has been cost reduction and even still their needs to be more reduced cost for everything. I'm Townhall 11 and attacking isn't enough anymore. I have to buy things from the shop to keep up.,2
"The game is very good. I would like to give only 2 star ,because it's have lots of problem which so irritated me such like game crashed and glitch showing black on the screen and also lots of problem,, I just want to requested to the devloper of the coc. Please solve the issues of the game crashing . Thank you.",2
I absolutely love clash. The only thing I would change is the account verification. Because if you lose an email or phone number supercell won't help you in any way tp verify your account. Other than that this game is sound and a great strategy game. I've been playing ever since the release.,5
"The game will get boring if the upgrade time is long, please reduce it. Can you please add private chats for coleaders and leaders to chat and can you also add some bases for each town hall for us to practice attacking, I know we can do that with out teammates but what if we want privacy and want to attack without someone seeing. It will be great to change troops in this practice than requesting. Great game and I hope my suggestions will be added in the next update!",5
"Alright it's been fixed,, I can play again and I changed my rating.. Thank You Super Cell! 6/28/22 Awful update! After updating, now it kicks me out before I can even do anything. It crashes on all my devices. I've been playing for years, but if this doesn't get fixed fast I'll just uninstall it.",4
"Ever since last summer the connection to the game servers suck. I have lost hundreds of trophies and have been demoted 3 times because I'll start an attack, use 4 lightning spells then loose connection to the servers. I have 4-5 bars of both my internet and mobile data at all times with 200MB of download and upload speeds. Connection is not my fault, it's Supercells. Don't play if you like winning.",2
"I do really enjoy this game. Literally, I have been playing it for 5 years nonstop. The graphics, the troops and the upgrades are really over the top. Indeed, it did strengthen from my ability to attack other and villages and defend mine. It worth all my time.",5
"Fun. Can be played as simply or as complex as you like. I'm a thinker normally, but enjoy an occasional ""everything forwards and turn it up to 11"" attack... Game is generally stable but occasional glitches can be annoying. Jury still out on clan capital element of game.",5
"You guys really need to have an option, an option that can make you pick if you prefer to see your own traps or not, rather than only having that option when your editing your base, it will then really tempt the player to see his base more cooler and nice, which will then might or not even might but would really increase player game time.",5
Overall the game is good and enjoyable.But the one thing i dislike in it is the time required for upgrades. I mean it takes days to upgrade a small building and u have only 4 5 builders which makes the progress very slow and over time it becomes kinda boring cuz you have filled your storages and waiting for the builders to upgrade and then the story continues. I wish they could reduce the time a lit bit.. otherwise game is fantastic 😊,4
"The game is great and quite interesting. But the only problem is that it takes too much time to train the troops and to upgrade, and moreover it's too expensive to upgrade heroes n troops please fix it. Thank you",4
"Update: App is immediently crashing probably just a minor bug, if supercell is reading this please note that this problem is only for android. And for the people who have said their flags are gone, go watch Judo Sloths first sneak peak and yes you did get refunded for the flags. Update(again): I fixed it by logging in my supercell id in another device then opened in my main device and now it works. Update: It happend again it seems like it haopens when i'm attacking in BB versus battles.",5
"Love the game been playing now for over 7 years. The recent updates have caused major issues for me. I am able to login and the terrain all loads in fine, then it freezes and turns off. I see builder base for a second or 2 then it's gone. I even uninstalled then installed the game.",2
"It was fun at first then after awhile of playing it will soon cause lag that drops frames everytime I play this game but when I use other apps it runs very smoothly but as soon as I open this game it will lag alot causing my device to do a restart. I tried to reinstall it worked for 5 minutes and then the lag started to came back again and now I can't login to my supercell account again. I tried reinstalling it again still same result, if this doesn't get fixed I won't get to play anymore.",2
"I really love the game and im not even getting bored of it! But there's this one problem in builder base because whenever i search for a battle I always come up with an enemy that has a higher level of builder hall than i have Im at bh8 and most of the enemies im facing is bh9 its just so unfair thats why i always lose! Been with the game for 4 years already and still, the game is good as always!!",5
This is probably the best update ever. Man I mean it. Removing the resources for training in the base camp is the best thing you could do to experience different strategies. The next move should be deleting the time needed for training exactly like the builder base. Free us and let us hunt the game,5
"Been playing this game since high school, I've had the same account on different phones throughout the years and every time I think I'm done with this game it lures me back in. It's great to see the game evolve and add new content considering I first picked up clash of clans over 10 years ago. Clash of clans was a great game when I first started out and it's a great game still.",5
"9 yrs and they still can't get the simple things right. Awesome game. Must have, but frustration is at an all time high now with AI being so bad. Requesting troops which you do a lot, is a nightmare with troops you received last time being requested again. When you don't want them troops again. You never requested for them troops. The simple things are forgotten",3
"Love the game. But I only have one problem with it, and it's the fact that you have to wait a long time to finish some stuff and I don't like that. Also can't afford gems so i am force to go wait for hours. I still love it tho I also like the fact that if you don't login for 2 months you will get a bonus. Anyways the game is fun 4 stars",4
"This game is amazing. Takes patience and determination, but very fun. Lots of events to participate in weekly. Great gameplay. Requires good Strategy and thought. Good clans with active players enhance the experience. Teamwork needed. Very very fun. Free to play is just fine. Don't need to spend a dollar.",5
"While playing CWL, I started my attack and within 2 seconds of starting the attack, it said ""connection lost"" and the game restarts, however my my internet is working fine, but the connection is lost just for 1 second and the game restarts. How much planning and effort goes into an attack, the developers know best and still they have not found a way to tackle this awfulll issue.",1
"First of all i love the game simple yet very entertaining also if the developer will notice my review i would like to suggest some things in the game, like when we play in multiplayer game and for me sometimes when im trying to search for opponents base and find a good loots sometimes I accidentally press the next button and will not be able to go back to that base I'd like to suggest that you put a back button for players like me who sometimes accidentally press na the next button.",5
"Game is crashing frequently, probability of crashing when I open it is 9/10. When I open the game, sometimes it crashes, sometimes it shows black screen, sometimes it just show my home base and I can't touch anything, sometimes it crashes when I click on war button, it even crashes when I click on news button, and the most chances of crashing is when I try to switch accounts, it's really very annoying that game is just crashing all the time. Please push an update as soon as possible.",1
"I used to play this game on a regular basis. Because, before the game was running very smoothly without any bugs or crash issue. But now when I've reinstalled the game it is not even starting and getting crashed right after I am starting the game. This is irritating me a lot, hope you fix this as soon as possible. Thank you.",1
Great game. It doesn't take much time daily to progress and fun. On and of for many years and I never had problem to catch up with the new staff. Can be played with or without cash and it's just as fun free. No stupid ads...,5
This is such a perfect strategy game . I'm playing this from 2012 and honestly still didn't get bored. Developers are adding more new features so that players will not gonna get bored . Even the skins of the heroes . The sceneries. Everything is just perfect. Not any issues at all 10/10 🤍,5
"best mobile game, you get to build up a village and make an army to take down other villages. Upgrading things may take a while but it's a very fun strategy game. You can pay to progress faster but everything is achievable without paying. No ads too!",5
"This is an awesome game. Ive been playing it for the past 7 years which says a lot. But I have to say that this game can become boring in a few instances. But this is overruled by the way you always come back. Of the seven years ive had the game ive only playes it for maybe 3-4, but I still love it. Easy 10/10",5
"EDIT day #2. They dont even seem to care that they're new update crashes the game, 2nd full day now . Bad enough each update is the size of a game , but most updates fail . Everytime an update is released I have problems forever. Just updated this morning and now the game crashes as soon as I load in . This might be what makes me quit. Losing out on clan games rewards and and my season pass . Not impressed",1
The game crashes again and again. Whenever I start the game it shows a black screen and crashes. It's getting annoying plz fix this suppercel. It is a good game I have played this since 3-4 years a good planed attack game but the crashes nowadays after the major update of clan capital it is crashing alot plz fix this . Hope suppercel sees this and fixes this Loved the game alot Hope so you fixes the crashes Thank you,1
"It's a sick game, it's goods but the more you have a high trophies the more it's hard to get.. I always encounter more than two higher level than my level and it gives you 3-5 trophies.. all I can say is what a brain.. Instead if the enemy is high level you get high trophies it's reverse.. What a shame",1
"While the game obviously wants you to spend your actual money on gems. It isn't pushy about it, it's a good system that is understandable. It works well. It's optimized great, this game is by every stretch, a perfect mobile game. You get on when you're bored, you get off when you're done. 5-20 minutes a day depending on how far you've advanced in the game, it's varied, interesting, fun, and the design is simple yet effective. Clash of Clans isn't just great for its funny acronym, it's perfect.",5
Overall this is a great game an absolute masterpiece but there is one problem for some reason when i am at the loading screen i get kicked out my internet is fine But it keeps kicking me out and ive tried reinstalling it and launching it but it keeps on crashing. Supercell can you please fix this ill change my review to five stars,5
"Wow ! it's a fun game. It's been 1 months since i started playing this game. It's safe & economically viable with low internet data. But i have a complaint. Of course, i didn't stay long in the game but while i was playing, he asked me to it up to 90MB & refused to open it. I'm so sorry to hear that, so I'm not happy about it. I recommend that you finish the full version of the game first & as soon as i opened without using anything , internet data was counting too much. What's the matter ?? 😦",5
"The most deserving game for 5 stars.the first time I downloaded it i was not able to understand about it,but this time it made me addictive. Just a concerned advice about the game and the developers is to lower the cost of upgrading of walls. It costs too much.But I swear its the best game and you must download it.",5
"The only phone game I keep coming back to. Been playing for over 10 years and am still loving it, the developers are doing a good job at keeping things interesting. I don't even mind spending money on the in-app purchases from time to time as there quite a few good deals every so often. Hands down the best mobile game I have ever played!",5
It almost 7 years I am playing coc and I loved it. But there is big problem. Since last few days coc game is not loading (opening). I tried every possible way to open the game. Then I searched for the solution in Chrome. Instead of solution It found out that many people have the same problem. Please fix it as soon as possible.,3
It's a great game but the process is too time consuming. Building up the whole profile to the max level take years. Reduce the upgrading time for buildings and troops then it would be better.,3
"It's the best game I played so far, but the glitches and occasional crash of the app itself caused the enjoyment to be thoroughly diminished. I hope that this issue would be solved as soon as possible since I really like this game. If it does, I'll leave five stars! =D",2
After reaching to town hall 11 everything takes a high amount to upgrade it's a kind a frustrating... that's alright but the main thing that spoils us to play that game is all upgrades take toooo long time that's crazy.... it's needs to decrease some times and the length of money,3
"Ive played this game off and on since it came out. Ive been on it for the last few years, because of how great it's become. Every update has come with amazing improvements, and no bugs. Its simple, yet strategic and detailed. 10/10 recommend.",5
"This game is so unfair, the trophy system is a failure. When i attacks on multiplayer battle with enemy who have same th level with me i only get 6-8 trophy, but when i get attacked by enemy who had the same th level i lost 20-35 trophy. It pissed me off. This is very unfair, fix your game.",1
"If strategy, domination, and satisfying upgrades are you! Its a must-play! I've had the game downloaded now for over 3 years, its the only game I've carried over; phone to phone. Never gets old.. unless your one to hate on AWESOME updates, and diverse game-play and options.",5
"iv been playing this game for a long time, and as a consequence of this iv restarted clash quite a few times always loosing my progress due to this (my b)till i decided to make a supercell account for my last replay of the game so i wouldnt loose progress. Got quite far till my phone broke. it took a little over a month to get a new phone and a few weeks again before i sorted out my phone and got clash, then to my shock my supercell had been deleted due to me being inactive for over 30 days. 😡",4
"After latest update both my accounts crash in builder hall and I can't get back on. I've tried reloading coc and my supercell ID and it still crashes. I've tried to contact support and I can't reach anyone. Love the game when it works, but not so much when I can't play. Fixed now. Thanks",1
"I only deductded one star because build/upgrade time can be a little long. Other people probably wouldn't have a problem with this, but impatient people like me can find that to be a little annoying. Other than that minor inconvenience, Great Game!",4
"It's really fun at start but gets reeeeally boring later on, upgrades take forever and too expensive attacking a base doesn't give half the amount. I got all 5 builders but all I can do is give them tasks and come back after a week. And the builder's base sucks, if the enemy base is harder I gotto watch my base being destroyed once I loose in a couple of seconds and even if I get all stars it not enoughfor any upgrades",3
"I back because now the training cost is free which gives us a chance to train the troop that we can't used before , but for me the only problem that i see in the game is the time Requirements to upgrade one building some building takes almost 7days to finish which is very long time i think it needed to shorten or decrease the time Requirement for upgrading one building but that just only my suggestion but still this game is great and awesome at the sametime more power supercell😊♥️",4
Season bank!? Please separate the season bank from the normal bank (make it untouchable like the treasury and/or allow upgrades to be paid for from a seprate season bank). I cant upgrade fast enough to use it so i keep getting raided and taken for a huge amount. No point in playing because every raid lowers my shield and i can't add resources to an already filled up storages. I'll update my review after some update.,1
"I have played this game for years now and with this update I'm confused on so many levels as to why they removed the one challenging aspect of the game, army cost. And it wasn't even challenging at that but you took that away just like infernos stopping healing, making it easier for the dumbasses that can barely function is not how you balance a game, it's removing the replay ability because you have no risk in attacking now, this is a terrible update.",2
"I love playing clash of clans and I have been playing for a long time now but ever since the update I cant seem to open the app anymore. It keeps telling me that I've lost connection to the server, check my internet connection and try again. I've been doing this for 3 days now and I still can't open it. Uninstalling and installing the game doesn't work either and I don't think my internet connection or my phone is bad. So please fix it if the server is the problem because I don't know anymore.",4
"Honestly really upset with where this has gone. I've played on and off for maybe 7 or 8 years and with how easy everything is nowadays I don't feel like there's a reason to play. It used to be a grind to get what you needed to do things but now there's not that same feeling with free army training, no healing time for heroes, reduced build costs/time and all these updates that made the game much easier.",2
"Perfect game progression plan, strategy, defence, war, farming, community, name it - this one has them all. Into my third month and with regular purchase I'm about to level 100. Best advice: don't rush your town hall! I made this mistake and now struggling to keep up with my clan mates. The purchase items could be a little more cheaper, considering how frequently we have to purchase! Best of all, it isn't as intensive and nerve wrecking as some other games out there! Its a full 5 stars for CoC!",5
"This is a great game, but it crashes so often I sometimes find it unplayable. My war attacks will get wasted because of crashing for seemingly no reason. I wish I knew how to prevent this, because it is the only thing that I find severely negative about this game.",2
"I've been playing this game since it has been released. I've had a multitude of accounts over the years. I love this game, no questions asked. Here's the problem. I had an account that I had lost the email and password to. So I made a new email and password and contacted Supercell Support. I told them everything that had happened and gave them all the information they wanted, except for a transaction receipt of my first purchase. I've run out of room to really type anything else.",1
highly recommended to play to low end phones..also its fun to play and communicate with world wide players and have fun.but there is one issue...cause they removed old sound systems..thats annoying..i loved previous sounds like each item has its own sound..but after the update..its gone...! hope you'll fix it...BTW its really good..love it.♥️,5
"I love this game, however, recently on a new samsung galaxy s20 the audio is awful, it is all static like, this issue is not present in other apps or audio, it sounds perfect and even in the youtube app playing the main theme sounds perfect, its just the clash of clans app. I loved the music and sounds, sadly now when i play most of the low and mid range sound are very distorted or just a static hissing. I appreciate any help so I can hear the excellent compositions and music!",1
"Very fun, the base editing and waiting for the next attack to test your defenses, or attack bases with the army and troops you've selected and upgraded. Your attack methods air or ground attacks puts you in control. I also love the weekly challenges and constant updates.",5
"Best game to pass your free time. Whenever you get bored you can open the game and see through all the upgrades. It is very interesting to compete with friends, to see who have more patient😅. Although the game is all about patient.❤️",5
"Ex player playing again. I played coc back when it was still ongoing to its success. Now years later, I download the game coz i need a steady & slow pacing game. Turns out, the game is still one of the best game out there. Didn't regret download it, to find all my castle is still the same as it was & still fun!",5
"Very fun game that I highly recommend. The building and upgrading takes days later on and building and army takes hours, but it is still fun watching my army smash the opponents defenses. The builder packs are the most worth it bundles to buy and start off fairly cheep. I also love watching my kingdom grow.",4
This is the best top game I have ever played. Usually whenever I download a game I will not stick to it and uninstall it but after playing this game i didn't even thought of uninstalling it. Also this game have a clan chat from which we can meet new friends.Now th 12 is also having its own hidden tesla. Th 13 is also introduced and it has a very powerful weapon of its own!! A new capital is also introduced where we have to collect the daily tokens and use them to upgrade the buildings.,5
"This is one of my favorite online games when I was young and up to this day. However, before I can log in from my social media and of course our Google account. And this month I installed, there was no other option to connect my previous account game. It's okay for me there's nothing I am mad but for some player who wants to connect there accounts from the previous this is a irritate for them.",5
I can't even play the game anymore. The game keeps crashing and goes to a black screen every time I open the game. Please fix this Supercell. I spent a lot of time grinding in CoC and reached TH8. Now I can't even open the game.,1
"The absolute best game. Unfortunately, ever since the last update, it has been resetting during battles costing you time, raids, troops,everything. It happens so often its has become unplayable. Hope it gets fixed",3
"The game itself has lost its reality feeling, how can any living thing not attacking over something which is hurting it inthe first place . I would very much like to understand how the character of the game works . As of 2017 the game was a very realistic and worth of playing but now has lost its reality taste. To the coc team ""please try changing the person who's responsible for thinking of the strategy in the game "" the stars ar only for the fact that it's graphics have improved. Thank you",2
"So I liked this game for a long time, I deleted it , and came back, and this time I cannot get my account back, this system is garbage, what's the point of the word google play services if it leads u to super cell Id it's so dumb, I will never play this again until its resolved and I will never be happy about this. ( Moving on from this. I got my progress back after months. Only came back because friends, so I still have a heavy feeling about my lost account.",3
"A big thumbs up to the developers and the entire team for this. The clan capital update made the game more fun, I wish the amount of gold and elixir needed to forge wasn't so much though. Is there also going to be a new town hall? since troop training is now free, people have so much elixir and nothing to do with it. For the wall breakers, could they throw bombs from a distance instead of going to the walls so they would be more useful? more than one unit per housing space would be nice too.",5
"After playing the game for a while i discovered that the game is actually cool, but it has some downsides like it takes too much Gems and Elixir to upgrade walls also takes too much time in upgrading Defenses and buildings,also when upgrading the barrack or spell factory you should be able to use the troops or spell you don't have to wait for the upgrading to finish before using them due to how long they take... 🚮",1
I have a suggestion for the management. Let us use 2 super troops in one attack with the activating option of at least 3 super troops in the game. Please. It will help us to attack in the war with more potentiality.,5
"It's a great strategy game to play, and quick pace with short notice to whatever your doing wether its a break at work or had a long day an would like to sit back an relax. Enjoying the clans, teammates you get clash with. Once you get started it takes more time as you play into it with upgrades and how many builders you have 'only up to you how you use your collectors elixrs and gold mines'. Pretty fun game, good luck clashing!",5
"Well at first I thought this was a very hard game since I saw the cost of all types of obstacles, and it was super expensive then I turned into TH5 it was a piece a cake you know. I hate it when the troops don't attack my prioritized building especially defenses, I wish Clash of Clans fix this by adding something in the settings. Also, I think that the Robot (Hero in Builder Base) is the dumbest hero of all time like he is so big but is dumb sometimes you feel me like when he attacks the guards.",5
"App crashes after June update. Following Builder Base battle the app freezes and then crashes. On restart the app returns to Builder Base, freezes and then crashes. I'm playing on an Android tablet. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it keeps restarting on Builder Base, freezing and then crashing.",1
I've been playing COC for almost 4 years now but this is the only time I've experienced this problem. Whenever I open the app it crashes causing my phone to automatically stop and turn black. Hope it'll be fixed soon.,3
"I don't care about how long it takes to upgrade a building or a troop, the only thing I hate about this game is that we can't use our heroes whilst they're upgrading. I mean what's the point of having heroes if they're just gonna sit there, doing nothing and just upgrading. It would've been great if we can use our heroes while they're upgrading. I don't have the time or the patient to wait till they're maxed level.",1
"Hi! This game is fun to play but after I update it, every time I try to open it, my game crash and kick me out of the game and wonder why? So I try to remove things in my phone like pictures and apps but STILL it doesn't work, I hope that it can be fix fast, because we have a clan war and the preparation is done. I need to attack, pls fix this😭😭",4
"The game is pretty good. Thank you Supercell for lowering the upgrade costs and times and making army training almost free. BUT, it is now taking forever to switch between accounts. It wasn't like this earlier. Kindly fix this with some update.",4
"I need help, I have an Account in this game, I haven't played it for about one year or a lot of months, when I try to reconnect my account with supercell the verification code did not send, I tried it many times, it's still did not send. I spent a lot of time building my base and now I cant reconnect it, I hope I get answer from the creator of Clash of clan about this,so I can change it to 5 stars",1
"I could give it a five star but the supercell support is in it's worst.Now we can't talk with the officials about our problem for lost ID in other ways(other options than O.T.T.O.). More over whenever a new update comes in it mostly don't let the game start. Supercell I request you kindly help us out like old support you had given us.Its been 6 year,since I had been in this franchise.I can't enjoy until you fix the bugs and thanking you, hope this was helpfull.",4
Crashes all the time. Had reinstalled and signed in again multiple times doesn't help. Was a great game but loosing interest when you can't even play for more than a few minutes before it crashes.,1
"Ok so I really, really like this game! But the reason I kinda hate the one problem. The people can attack me but I have a shield! Like fix this bug, I hate when I'm afk, and I'm attacked even though I have shield! Fix it and I will give a 5 star. P. S. The game items and buildings, they cost to much!!",1
Introduce an arcade style game thats broken. Until now i had never experienced blue screen of death on mobile. This rushed variation of the game should have had a little more effort into making it work for more than 1 minute,3
I have chromebook and this app does not load it will start and a black screen pops and then the app crashes I have unistalled and restarted my laptop many times but it will not load . My chromebook updated to the lastest Chrome Os system software . It would be nice to get a bug fix or something.,1
I absolutely love this game and always have however I don't like that army training is now free it takes away the need to balance your army and keep the cost low. Also it makes it so you can just attack anyone no matter how much loot they have because you don't need to sustain the cost of your army but other than that it's amazing.,5
it keeps disconnecting. even during attacks. i turned off notifications but i still get notifications. it says there is update and i cant play till i update. i come to the playstore and it doesnt show any update. i have upgrades going and its a waste of time to check all the time for an update that isnt there. the game is unfair. if you are not in a clan your progression will half speed. matchamking sucks.,1
"Been a good real time strategy game. Not sure I like free troops and spells. I had to learn to play smart/economical. Waiting a long time from maxing out my base, haven't had anything to upgrade for months except the Capital city",4
"I'm regretting now ..... 1: troubleshooting network problem 2: I'm in legend league btw.. it litrly took 7 hr to search for a base for attack I'm down 3: smooth network still saying network issue 4: lagging infinity while doing atck war , normal ....this game used to make me happy like this is my everything 🗿hard to believe these things happening but I'm still playing.... Try to solve these problems so many clashersh out there struggleing ... Clash on 🏆✨I'll update my review again . thanks",5
"Fun strategy and tactics game to pass the time. It kinda sucks you in with the whole ""Revenge"" aspect and brings out competitiveness. With dragons, witches, and more there is alot to keep you around and wanting to see more‼️",5
"CoC lets you build a base, you can keep upgrading, there is basically no end, but the farther you go the more powerful your base gets, and you can use your trophies to show off, but only if you have friends in real life who also play",5
"This game is total trash! Especially the builder base! Your troops destroy one thing and then go to the next farthest thing they can find or they start walking around the wall to something that's farther away and then change their mind and come back? That's totally stupid! The developers are total morons that either don't know how to run a game or just trying to irritate people into quitting! Game used to be good, now it's total garbage!",1
This game is very awesome i play this every day but i think there is problem about dragons. Why? Bacause every time i attack i always clear the side so the dragons can go straight forward to the TH but they always gowing in side of the base so i can't get 3 star they're choosing to go in the side Instead of going to the middle. I experienced this when the new update came. Please fix this problem,2
"Such a good game, I thought it was overrated so I never tried it until I got sick of seeing my friends playing it all the time, so I was going to beat them at their own game! Only thing I want to complain about is my production utilities (gold mine and elixir collector) Occasionally recieve a boost on specific days, but if you build new producers while this boost is active, there is no effect on the new producers. Otherwise I love the game! (I hope the devs see this and possibly reply)",4
I'm using a very old phone and it works just fine. I really enjoy this game. I'd probably play this for a long time. The things is tho those green diamonds are very expensive and bulding time can really take time and I have no other thing to do but wait so i exit out of the game which makes it hard to be stimulating cuz my gaming is not continuous.,4
"A strategic army and base designing game with fresh awesome content always to come. Keep it up devs! Only thing I would suggest is builder hall 10 with another hero, may be a machine the master builder has to get parts to make, as I'm fully maxed and we've been waiting years.",5
It fun and creative game to play you have to have good experience to play this game cause it kind of hard for starters to play but if you keep building you village and up grade I'm a town hall 6 yes it takes a while to get up there and stuff takes up to a day some times it will get up to 3 days to upgrade yes it does not for me yet but mine up to a day right now it fun some time cofussing. You get to fight other people and there practice and single player if you like to play them it fun🥰,4
I love the game it's like sims on crack. Only problem I have now is I just updated the new summer version and now I'm not able to get back on. App keeps closing as soon as the loading game screen is completed. Help me please I'm having COC withdrawals.,5
"Clash of Clans, the game that has built, upgraded and geared-up memories. Such a great experience to grow up with; a welcoming, friendly community and fun gameplay. Though it can take years to max your villages, you're free to play in whatever style you want: Rush your base for new troops, spells and ways to attack or be patient and upgrade gradually. The new Clan Capital update is the greatest way to unite all clan members and leaders alike! Overall a super fun experience.",5
"I love this game! it's fun but the upgrades..after you upgrade a few things a few times (especially town halls) the wait time gets annoying and it becomes a 'wait until builders are done before you can really do anything again' type of game. and the clan Chat, I know there is a profanity filter but even when it's off it tags out ""ok"" and brawl stars does it to and it makes no since because it's not a cuss word nor is it offensive? other than that, great game!",4
Coc please see to it......when ever I'm on attack if my net goes yhe whole progress is lost like dude.....I'm attacking in war my my wifi turned off but my mobile data was on still it logged out and my attack was a total waste......it should pause and try to reconnect once again but if there is no response form the player after 30 or 40 sec then you should log out......but If there no net for nearly like 10 sec the game log out the user......so please see to it.....so it's my very humble request,1
".why do you offer upgrades when all they do is keep crashing every time you log in to the game. Can't log in at all with todays upgrade. Spent money on puchases today. Should i uninstall will i lose thoses purchases, clan game rewards or every thing else that i have pending. This is not good if its happening to many of your players......i would like this game better if it didn't crash all the time..... Very disappointed that issues with my upgrade have not been resolved.",1
"Clash of clans is a strategy game.This is the game which I want for a long time.No one hate this game. I had been played this game for a long time. The most important thing of this game, it is free like valorant pc.But a minus point of this game is it's troops need training. I request the main developer of this game to fix this error.Moreover,I have found some bugs and glitches. Over all the game is very energetic.I thanks to all developer of this game.",5
It's a good game but sometimes when we are attacking a village and suddenly the game crashes even though I have destroyed 98% of the village after the game is reloaded it shows that I have only destroyed 5% and lost. The recent update has messed this game up.,3
"This is a killer game, I've been playing for 2 years now and it just keeps getting better!! I changed my Google account from my other phone number and I didn't get my 10$ google pay card with my account can you please straighten out the mess up sirs? But this is a great game and I have been playing it for 3 years now and I plan to keep playing it!u don't know what your missing out on if you don't have it but on your phone",5
"The new update is all good but the removal of traning costs was a big bummer. The village is a form of small economy where in there is a cost for everything and it must be so, removal of traning costs removes the part of profitability from the raid the only major expence left is upgradation of buildings and troops. The traning costs are an important factor considering as coc is a strategy based game. Removing the costs makes it more easier to play and doesn't feel engaging enough.....",1
"Right now I can't even get on clash, it keeps crashing after a black or green screen. I try redownloading it and restarting my phone and clearing cache and storage but it doesn't work. It's been going on for a couple of months now. Somebody please fix this.",1
"Great game. I've played it many times, started over and over again and the only other thing that I could say is that things should take less time/gems to build and upgrade. Still though, it's among the best mobile games I've ever played!",5
Glitchy af. I collect my loot and get rid of some obstacles and a few minutes later it's as I didn't do anything. I have to recollect the loot and remove the same obstacles again. Been going on for over a month now.,1
"Overall the game is great but since the last update my game opens and the moment it comes to home village, it stucks there and close the game automatically. Have tried uninstalling and install again but still the same issue. Please fix it. I love this game and addicted to it.",1
Buying stuff on this game is a rip off. They charge wayyy too much for virtual perks. Costs (virtual gold / elixir)way too much to up grade and takes too long to upgrade. If you have patience it can be fun the people/clans are fun to interact with.,3
"Its a Great Game, I am planning it past 8 year... There are some suggestions: 1. There should be an option to use cooked army inside the barracks instead of army camp's army. 2. There should also an option to add previous war participants in clan wars. Sometimes when we start war of more than 15-20 player out of 50 then it it hard to remember whome to select.",4
"I love the game alot , i have been playing for some years now but i just hate how much time it takes to upgrade in higher level and the amount of gold used on walls . I also wish there could be one more hero in the builder base .",5
"I love this new upgrade, no need for training cost. That's the most considerate game I've played in a while. Though, the building time is too much. Now for a electro dragon, I have to wait for 7 days. I'd suggest to make an update to max such building to 3 days",5
"The new update is quite big and successful . But I think builder base loot should be buffed too, as because when you used up all your 3 wins and get a worth of 300k-400k something you cannot accept that it still is not enough for the upgrades you'll need . hope this will kind of have a little raise so that player will not have to worry increasing their trophies just to get a higher loot.",4
This is super addictive and fun to grind but the problem is that this game caused my phone to call an SOS call by itself 2 times it crashes and makes my phone freeze for a minute and when i try to turn it on again it turns it off by itself and lots of freezes in the game please fix this so i can play it again,2
"The game is good for relaxing and leveling, but please add donwload option for those who want to play or not about the other mood/vilage. its kind anoying to see that thing where we need to play that mood but some people dosnt like it. i hope your r&d is more creative and simple.. when you add too much mood make sure its have option to download or not..... please..",3
"After this new update my game keeps crashing every time when I relogin. No matter how many times I have reinstalled, it is crashing like hell. I have 2 acc. With supercell id. One is TH 7 and other is TH10 max, I had no any issue with TH7 acc. But I am unable to login TH 10 due to crashing problem.",1
Can you just add an option for the builder giving a next building equipment as i usually forget to put upgradation after completion of previous works of builder. And my suggestion would be for that the the cost will be completely deducted from storage & if someone wants to cancel the next upgradation he will get back half of the costing for the upgradation cost. So that i will be able to manage my builder wisely and wont have to remember to put for upgradation of my equipments.,5
"This is genuinely a good game it just takes a lot of time, like an obserd amount of time I'd suggest if you play this to take your time and go on it whenever you feel like it. and a tip if your looking to download it, max all your buildings and troops for your Town Hall. 😁",5
"I've been playing this game since 2015, never got disappointed... but after the previous update.. neither my clanmates nor the opponent clans are able to attack in war... we ain't able to scout the base or attack... please look into this matter and try to fix this bug... Thank you!",1
"In one of Versus attack in builder base, I scored 100%. When I finished the attack, I saw the opponent was still attacking and the result was in waiting mode. After around 15-20 seconds, I saw the result displayed ""defeat"" for me. The opponent had also scored 100% damage. But the ""time left"" displayed for his case was more than me. How is this possible when I finished first and I waited for the opponent to complete the attack. This is either a hacking attempt or a defect in the game.",1
Playing daily for about 8 years but not anymore. Since more recent updates it crashes and freezes constantly and I have plenty of free memory. It's become very frustrating.,2
"Dear supercell, God do I love your game, the only thing I wish there was, is more content updates. But this would be 5 stars if it wasn't for 1 reason, I can't log in. I've seen other ppl have this problem. We need this fixed, pronto! Edit: The bug has been fixed, nicely done supercell 10/10",5
"I've been playing this game for over 6 years now. I've stopped playing for small periods over that time, maximum a month. However, I always enjoy returning and advancing my villages further and further. This will likely be a constant over the next few years as well!",5
"Games great, but troop prices add a challenge to the game, a risk, but now I don't care if lose or win an attack. A part of the game is to make a cheap effective army and try to make a profit. I don't know why I even attack anymore.",4
I think clash of clans is Supercell's best developed game because even after so many years I still see active clans even in my country! #1 strategy game for sure because there are countless base layouts and features that you can use to demolish the enemies base. Also the new update is pretty great and mysterious (Clash got the idea from Brawl Stars I think and it is pretty cool). Thank you supercell for bringing us ways to get smarter playing video games that are easily understandable!,5
It is an AMAZING game. I enjoy playing it an I always recommend it to my friends. I also love the videos that they make. It would be cool if they made some sort of series on YouTube or something because their videos are AMAZING just like the game. Please keep up the amazing work!!❤️❤️,5
"I really enjoy clash of clans however since the new update for the 10th anniversary I cannot play the arcade machine for very long the screen turns light blue. Please fix this issue as I would like to play them, asides from that it is a 5* game but until this is rectified I am changing my score temporarily to 4*",4
"Definitely have improved the game, I've always loved this game a great way to pass the time. And you can go at your own pace. It's either pay to be top, clever to be top, or turtle it out. With a good clan you can get support. This game is about networking for satisfaction",5
"Great game has come out with tins of updates before, use to be a 3, in my books, now it's a 5 star, free to play aspect is great even If it takes a lil longer But the season pass is awesome able to reduce reduce times on building etc. Overall great game keep up the good.work and updates!!",5
"The experience has never changed since its release. Love the nostalgic feeling I get from the game while also loving the excitement I get from new events and active players still. However there are a ton of bots in the game. They join clans randomly, tell them to go to a ""get free gems"" website then leave and it's quite annoying. Game is still getting 5 stars from me.",5
Really sad to see what has become of coc now. I started coc way back in 2015 and continued playing in bits and parts but managed to reach th12 with 148 experience. It was a really fun game and I have a lot of memories associated with the game. But now they have made troops training free which really is a big insult to all the players that grinded for all these years. A real shame,3
"Excellent game it's got all of the topics I love adventure, action and it's super fun. (It's very addictive aswel) Although the time I have to afk and wait for my buildings, resources and defences to finish upgrading is horrendous but still... THIS GAME IS SO GOOD!!!",4
"When I made a clan three or so years ago, I thought I was late to the game, no one would want to stay, etc. Years later I'm a maxed th14 and have made several international friendships and maintained a positive environment for all. Great game, I just wish I weren't sitting waiting for more content in the main base.",5
"I love this game so much because when I attack enemy i enjoy watching my troops destroying enemy bases and gained lots and it so challenging game.im in TH7 now and my base improved so much,my only problem is when I upgrade my high level buildings it takes more than 6 days before it upgrade but still worth it when in finish",5
"The waiting time for upgrading the defenses, troops and heroes are to long, maybe the developer can shorter it a little bit or half of the current time and days of all the uprading time of all units in this game. And maybe thats the i will increase my stars. I'm sad of the long waiting time for upgrading in this game.",4
"The Versus mode is ridiculously unfair, i always match up with people having like 32 archers when i only have 8, and all of them are overleveled because they use the buff potion, why do i need to match up with the people with low trophies because of how much they suck playing without paying, and instead get people that have the same level or troop numbers. I have no chance at winning.",2
This game is awesome the good thing about the game is the amount of time it takes for a building to upgrade which keeps me playing the game a little more but a few adjustments super cell should make is the amount of loot you collect in the builder base but aside from that this game is great,5
The AI for troops is terrible and always works in the opposite way of how I want them to. Everyone spams electrodragons (even when ineffective) so it's a rarity when someone attacks your base using ground troops. Could be better if there were more uses to dark elixir and the economy for the shop is unequal and broken,1
Ok changing my review no training cost no never and I hate it but some new changes are good. But they need to bring back training time in Builder base. It take the strategy out of it. Honestly I really don't like it as much as I use to. And I would like more in builder base like new levels I just don't think Clash of Clans will be as fun as it use to be.,3
The game is very good but I don't like how it takes time to upgrade. please if the time of upgradeing things can be reduced the game will be perfect This is the best game you can ever play I need to be chatting with friends in different can plz add that up in the next update It's boring when you have a friend you can not chat,4
"The game crashing again and again after the clan capital update and it's really annoying because I've been trying to play this game from so many days but im not even able to load into the game , the game crashes on the loading screen !!! Please fix this",1
"I hate this verification problem, it's not sending code although it says they sent it. Took me couple of years before returning to this game, but I get so disappointed when I got to retrieve my existing account. I'm impatient and I don't like having problems which actually can be solved by the developers. Please fix this, I've researched about this and this is now a long term problem of your app. My goodness",1
"Game is amazing, the only problem is that of time, i prefer COC to shorter time of upgrade, if this issue improved by coc then it would be great, please shorter the time of upgrade things, 14 days to upgrade and i have only 2 workers 😅....those who can buy gems for them its easy but for people like me, its really hard to play like this games. Please k request you to shorter your time of upgrade.",1
"I love this game but I think there's a bit of a problem when I opening the app, it's loading takes too much time but it doesn't open at all it immediately takes me to my home screen I don't have any problem in my phone and wifi and in order to open it I have to uninstall and install the app so that I can open it, please supercell fix this I really love your game",3
"It takes alot of time to upgrade heroes even barracks and spell factory which is vital in attacking...basically if your going to upgrade heroes, there useless.. if don't upgrade their weak, which mean useless... Matching system in clan war is also unmatched... matching should base on th level and current armies and defences built... if there th rush and their defense building or troops level are low, obviously that's the account owner's fault for not following proper way of upgrading",1
"This game used to be fun amd I spent several months grinding trophies. I went from 900 to 3960 in a relatively short amount of time, just to have it all come crashing down. First, the hackers. I was for some reason targeted multiple times by what I believe to be hackers. I was raided I believe 5 or 6 times in a span of a few hours in the night while I slept. Not only did my shield just not work, but I was being raided by people 1000 trophies above me and losing 36 trophies every time. No more",1
I absolutely love this game and always have. I really wish it had an offline feature tho. Like if you currently don't have service or wifi and you could still be able to open the app and make base edits or train an army or do something like that,5
This game takes a really long time to progress if you are free to play upgrading defence when your a high town hall take weeks but if you have the money to spend it can take you 3 days or maybe even less but in the recent updates it really favor free to play players because you dont have to spend high resources to attack and you wont lose any more resources for bad attacks and i hope they keep favoring free to play player's and i hope that they can lower the price of the battle pass,3
".. good game .. but culture of the game seems a little one faceted - could do with a few more features to allow for different clan cultures - eg. voting button, more regulatory permissions for leaders .. an easier way to strategise in clan wars that allows everyone who chooses 2 have input, 1:1 player msg'ing & replying, even if limited .. search for players by country / age / sex if looking to build a specific kind of culture or clan .. even maybe by interests",4
"I have been playing this game since it was released. One of the BEST GAMES EVER!!! SUPERCELL has not put out a bad game. Game play is smooth,great graphics, and very minor issues here and there. Support team is excellent! I recommend to everyone. Age appropriate and friendly game play for all. CLASH ON!",5
"Lmao! It doesn't matter if u reconnect after just a few seconds during an attack, even in war... Your attack just stops like What the hell!🙄 Please improve this thing at least the troops deployed should be trying to finish their work after we have disconnected...",1
"In Builder Base, Pekka's AI need to be improved, while attacking if last two objects left in same distance so all Pekkas use to go in one direction to destroy one object then they go to destroy the second one instead of going in both directions. It consumes time.",3
This game is good and strategic but sometimes i think this is wrost game because in defence and other's upgradation takes very much time after 10 town hall so i requested you to solve this issue and decrease the time period of upgrading defence and other's. Thank you 💗,3
"Rubbish, too much lag and issues with the game to play properly, always adding new things may seem great but the stability of gameplay is effected, consistent lag or log in issues between my gf and myself on two different contents, I have been playing close on 3 years, I am gonna remove the game. It has just become not worth getting upset over when loosing connection the whole time in battles and war. A game is ment to be fun, not frustrating. Clash has become frustrating.",1
"10/10 great fan of clash of clans. i lost my account. I spent thousands on the game. i borrowed my account to a friend and they shut it down because of ""suspicious activity"". If you're going to let people use it on different devices, please also make it safe. The support system did not help at all,even after giving the account code and name AND supercell id password, they needed all the names of all the devices my account was played on, and the first purchase. They don't care about players.",1
"I started playing this game a few weeks ago. Although it is a nice game, the time used to upgrade the buildings is unfair for poor players. The upgrading time should be lowered so that many players would enjoy the game.This thing has to be solved. I will give it 4 stars.",4
"I changed it to 4 stars because everytime I update it to a newer version it crashes right away, it fails even though I have strong data and wifi connection. When it goes to 100% it goes back to 0% to reinstall again and I always need to reboot my phone, clear data and clear cache. That's all my feedback for now. Please fix the issue.",5
"It's a really good game, truly it is. It lets me log in but the wifi indicator seems so be stuck so I can't do anything else. The problem has been persistent for weeks now. Unless you solve this problem my review will remain 1 star. Please fix this now ASAP. Maybe then I'll you the 5 star rating back.",1
"It has a bunch of waiting time but it makes up for it with a huge amount of gems gained through anything, i dont like buying and this is perfect. More than a year later and I just redownloaded the game, even when your in bootcamp you still have fun.",5
"This game is fun I've been playing for a few years now. I like the whole game itself and how you can join a clan. Over the year they have added new features which make the game more interesting. So its not just about the same thing over and over. The only thing I dislike is how high in gems it cost to buy things within the game such costumes for heroes, potions,etc therefore you'll have too purchase gems to purchase those things.",4
Matching making sucks in night base if ur th 5 u would get a th 6 player and it's hard to fight also always says internet reconnect when my bar is at full and can't play. Plz fix this.(after 2 months) Bro im back again and i was in a mid-battle and my connection went off and i automatically lost it. Plz fix this when im in mid battle plz don't let me lose my trophies or troops.,2
"Great game, I like how your constantly upgrading and becoming stronger. I do feel that some of the upgrade timers are absolutely insane. Just another way to get you to spend real money.",3
"I enjoy this game so far. But the reason why I will only rate this with 2 star, because I can't recover my old account, the Otp number is not working even my email is active, I already review the settings of my email but still the I can't recieve an Otp number. Hope you fix this and I'm looking forward to play my account as soon as possible.",2
"I absolutely love this game. Been playing shortly after it first came out. However after this last update, I can no longer play. It keeps crashing and booting me out of the game. After many restarts and reinstalls, nothing is helping. Please fix this,I love this game.",2
"I mean considering the game designed and data integrity on a developer perspective this is probably thw best designed app I've experience, just perfectly great, the game is also really interesting and engaging. Overall its a great game, that deserves recognition and 5 star. You can't find anything bad about it.",5
"Awesome game, I love every concept. I like hopping on and doing upgrades and sometimes spend a long time doing other stuff such as raids, and it is totally different than all the other moblile games which I love. Keep up the good work",5
"The new update is awesome. But the game sometimes gets reloaded while watching base or editing. The worst time ever, when I'm attacking in CWL or normal wars. I have a stable network also. So try to check this situation.",3
"This is the Great Game. I am playing since 5 years ago. But now I have created a new acc after a long time And A thing got my attention that, the upgrades are too long it is just fine till Townhall 8. In Townhall 11 and after that There are Some upgrades which takes like more than 5 days 10 days wtc.. Some are also 20/25 days. Which are too long.Overall It is a great game.",4
If new player start to play this it's like waste of money and time I mean for new player reaching townhall 14 and Max all the thing it's like 4 to 5 years. So he can not compete in tournament. Make a game so that new players also can enjoy. For upgrading one building or one troops 15 to 20 days I mean seriously 😳,1
"Ive been playing this game since years, however theyve lost the plot and made it so much more complicated and overtly detailed. Need one map and one base to focus on, no need to make 3 and make me work on all.",1
"Great game my only thing is that the match making could be better, people higher than me always attack my bace and destroy me with ease, and I can attack people lower than me and get resources with ease, don't get me wrong I like the resources but I also like the challenge. But other wise great game",4
"Overall quite fun if you know how to play... However, after reaching townhall 11 or 12,progress becomes very slow.. So the upgrade time should be lessen.. As many players becomes inactive for a huge upgrade time...",5
"Clash of Clans is the best game ever. It's fun to play because there is so much to do and you never ever get interupted by ads. It's not a pay to win game but buying things will help you out. Even if you get bored because an upgrade is too long and you have nothing to do for a couple days, you can make a new account and challenge yourself to beat the game faster. I have been playing the game for 10 years and I can't remember a single time I didn't enjoy it. I would recomend this game to everyone",5
"It's a one best strategy game but the problem is also with it. In my phone why don't know but it consumes much battery and even when i closed the game sometimes it still running on background. And my system sends me message that ""clash of clans"" consuming High battery immediately stop it, then i had to go tp battery settings and then click optimise. & Is okk now but it starts readonmly anytime please fix this issue. My device battery is being drained like water flows on river.",2
02/03/22 I have an old account that is connected to my gmail and it keeps saying i need to verify by putting my email and then it says it will send a verification code to my email but it won't appear in my inbox i have tried everything. Even using my friends account it just won't send the code! Was it really necessary to verify my account like that? Such a big waste of time. Edit: months later and it's still won't send me a verification code.,1
A few years ago this game was the best thing on Play Store. But they've changed so many things the economy in this game is all but dead. I wish this wasn't the case I've spent a lot of money and time on this game without global chat this game will never come back. It's a good game dang amazing but the player count is lower than I've ever seen it and I check in weekly. Only people I see still attempting to say this game is alive are the youtubers who jobs rely on it.,1
"I really love this game and I wanted to play it after a very long time but it just kept crashing when I opened it. I tried reinstalling the game, hard restting my phone and also switch networks but nothing worked , PLS fix this supercell",1
I have been playing for the last 1 year and the upgrades are getting longer and longer they are enhancing the experience for people who are on bigger townhalls but not for smaller ones I think they should add that where every build is time less so every person could learn new strategies and many more in the end its a great game,5
I have some suggestion for Clash of Clans game it it will be so helpful. I was wondering if there was a possibility to make a small update. That the leader and co-leaders can see who started construction in the Capital Hall. There are players who deliberately open new upgrades and slow down the construction in this way. That would be of great importance to us because we would be able to eliminate those who sabotage. Have a nice day. Thank you!,4
"I am playing this game since 3 years years.This was one of a best game that I played at that time,But after the clan capital update, the game gets crashed every time I log in.After the recent maintanence brake the game started to run smoothly,but after a week later It was back to square 1.pls fix this bug.I don't want to lose the progress again",1
"Clash of Clans is an amazing game, but I only have 1 problem and that is the matchmaking in clan war leagues. I started a new clan with friends and we were basically all low levels but we had to vs clans that only has Townhall 12 and up. It's honestly not fair and basically a put off for the rest of the clan. Yes it's not always about winning but how are we supposed to be confident if we lose all the time. Please respond and fix that.",3
"The Game is good, it is a recommendable game, but nowadays I am having a hard time to increase my trophy rank bcoz, everytime I attack in multiplayer battle, most of the opponents are higher level than me and almost all have a below 10 trophy that you can get after 3 star which frustrates me, I hope you fix it. Overall it is a good strategy games.",3
"I think Supercell leaks the user data to hackers. Probably that's why it's been months since I lost my account but got no help at all. My account was working fine one moment and the next moment someone else was playing it after REMOVING my registered gmail from it and I couldn't log in again using my mail. What's worst is that the support channel from inside the game is trash as the bot O.T.T.O is good for nothing and if I try to contact through mail, my messages are ignored.",1
"The game is starting to crash whenever I go into capital peak. Please fix this. Edit: It was fixed and everything is working perfectly fine. Also, the game is very time consuming and fun.",5
"This game is awesome. Lots of strategy and building and attacking. Working together as a clan in clan league wars, wars, and clan capital is all fun. However, the game crashes WAY TO MUCH with the new update and the clan capital. PLEASE FIX THE BUGS. The game would be amazing if it didn't crash so much!",1
"Great game but the wait times are ridiculous. At townhall nine you need to spend at LEAST a month getting your heros to max level, (including other buildings it would be about six months,) and once you go through all of that waiting; guess what! You need to do it again at townhall ten... and eleven... and twelve... and thirteen... and fourteen... you can see where I'm going with this.",5
The game is awesome but nowadays it's getting some glitches... It's not opening... The bar loads and then suddenly the screen goes black and the game exits... This is happening again and again... Please fix this issue asap...,3
Lots and lots of hackers in this game trophie pushing is impossible. lots of bugs and glitches with troops go anywhere they want always away from townhall and defences. level 1 defences damage like Max defences in some Chinese players bases. just bad experience with multiplayer Otherwise game is good . I like clan wars.,1
I always have and always will love clash of clans. It has always been a fun experience raiding other people for loot and using it to upgrade my own village. And it feels so good to see all the progress pay off. It feels good to have a good village. Every upgrade feels good. And every update feels good. Supercell always brings out these cool updates adding a bunch of new things to clash of clans ensuring that theres always plenty of new stuff and they never disappoint. CoC is truly a great game.,5
"Thought I would get back into this and well, I can't access my account anymore because of my new phone, years of playing this for nothing, this game has been around long enough, it should be easy to regain access to your account, but nope. Not restarting considering how far I was in it, this game is dead.",1
"My experience of the process to recover one of my accounts is disgust. I followed everything I was to do even supplying my earliest in app purchases back in 2015 and gamer tag which is unique and generated bu supercell and customer still couldn't find it. All I needed was the email I used given I have multiple accounts, spent thousands of dollars to supercell, and clashed since the year it launched, and yet I'm rewarded with service that is flawed and lost thousands of dollars.",1
I'm irritating while opening it bcoz when I try to open the game just finish it's half loading and the game goes crashed and so the screen become black why supercell why??????????????? 😖😖😖. This is not only for one time it's happening for several times but still ot showing black,1
"100 % an awesome game for my phone. I love the option of being able to create multiple bases, and being able to ""copy"" an enemy base. I've been a fan now for like 8 years. It's cool being able to communicate with people all over the world. A couple of things I've noticed that needs adjustments, in my opinion is. It takes way too long to upgrade buildings when you become a high level townhall. Also, buying anything with gems cost wayyyyy too much. But a great game. For real.",5
"I am enjoying this strategy game so far. For a beginner like me, it was easy to figure out. No blood and guts either! The only difficult thing is acquiring carpenter huts used to upgrade or build items. If you don't want to wait a long time for your points to accumulate, you have to pay money for them. Also, further on in the game they encourage you to use dark magic potions in your battles, which I find evil and a definite drawback.",4
I've played this game for about 6 years. I love it. It's not pay to win. You can do everything for free. But you can speed up the process 3 fold by buying the gold pass each month which pays itself off. It gives you many items worth more than the cost of the actual pass. Supercell update and keep control of this game in many ways that even Triple A Console studios don't.,5
"5/5 I love it, would download a 2nd time if it wasn't for Google limits. 1 thing I must mention is, the game is very grindy especially in the later Town halls. Supercell somewhat alleviated this via the end of season rewards. Alleviate doesn't mean solve though, if you willing to see this as a 2nd job, yeah, GO FOR IT. But for the ones who get on, play for 2 hours then get off. They're going to have a slower time upgrading. But it IS possible and to me, after all of that. It's a worthy download.",5
The game was excellent. I had a made a quite huge progress within a few days. But after these recent update my game isn't opening. When I'm clicking the icon a black screen appears and my game crashes. I tried to contact with supercell with a help form but it didn't get send. So I'm here please fix this as I've made a huge progress and and I didn't want to loose it. 🙏🙏🙏,4
"It's a really enjoyable game if you like to plan and strategize. In game purchase are incentivized and help you progress faster, but you can get to max level using free to play (though it takes quite awhile). I've been playing for a month now and upgrades have slowed down a bit. Playing multiple accounts has kept me busy though.",5
I only have a little bit of problem with the notifications. I want to be notified immediately when my builders available so i can put it to work again. Sometimes it notifies me but sometimes it doesn't. So i hope it could be improved.,4
Clash of clans is the best online game I have played so far but I just have a couple of suggestions could you give us a one time event for a free hero skin and one more problem if you have a base that you want to send out for a friendly challenge and you accidentally moved 1 wall we have to wait until 24 hours to send that base again so please fix that and even if heroes are upgrading let us be able to still use them in friendly challenges and please add some more clan perks👍 TH 14 IS HERE!!🤯,5
"I absolutely loved playing this game, but unfortunately I had to get a new phone and went from apple to android. I was told by the store employees that I would not have any problems transferring my account over, but that's not the case. The app transfered over, but my account didn't. So, I contacted Supercell immediatelyfor help and after a couple different trys with the representative it wasn't working andhe banned my account for 31 days for phishing, I don't even know what that means.",1
This game is good! It has been some years since I played this game and the best thing is there literally there is no ad I am very satisfied with your game I gived it a four star cause of the obstacles we need a thing that can clear obstacles there is already on in the game but it is useless so ples add one more ! Great game must play,4
While playing game network data automatically disconnected. Then reconnect takes long time. Please help me to clear the bug . Data connection working fine other apps at same time. So help me as soon as possible,1
"Worst matchmaking in multiplayer battles, Im a fresh th9 and matches with th10 with a few count of trophies as well as th9 with fewer count of trophies, and another issue is the trophies that had been deducted to you is 3x moren than you get. Cant even go to the next league because of this",1
"Generally very enjoyable game, but since the removal of global chat it just feels so lonely and isolated. This game was never just about building bases and getting better; the social aspect was a key part of what made the game great. Removing global chat basically ended that part of the experience, which is a true shame. I've heard so many stories about players leaving the game because of it. Supercell should really think about bringing it back.",1
"I love the upgrades, always something new, whether it be upgrades, or mini games added in, and the ability to play with people on every continent, and join them is AWESOME!!!",5
"I love this game. I've been playing it for years, but with the recent update it's in my eyes ruined the fun and the world community. Let me elaborate, ever since super cell got rid of flags the community can nolonger show patriotism for their country in clash. Along with this the recent update that added elixir free troop training is a major problem. By getting rid of the training cost you simply remove the risk and reward aspect of the game. I hope yall understand my reasoning.",1
"This game is not bad but not so good. The main problem with this game is, when I do versus battles, I have to face higher level opponents than me. I request to Supercell to repair this problem. So the game will be fantastic",1
It's so so so good 10 out of 10 but I would like it if they added and if they can add this please do so if you could attack your own base to see what you need to change and get a better understanding of the attack side of your base!!,5
"NERF DRAGONS... please I can't take it anymore. I spent 9 days upgrading 3 of my 4 air defenses. After they finished I thought that would help. No. Immediately 3 starred because it doesn't matter what level your stuff is. The air troops are so overpowered and so strong at Town Hall 11, there's no point in upgrading walls because it seems only 5% of the players actually use the other troops other than dragons. Theres no point and if I'm being honest you guys have ruined this game.",2
"This is definitely one of the games ever. I recognize that is game exist and that it is playable. The graphics are there, the building works, and the gameplay is gaming. They should add a super electro dragon",5
"If you have to look at my review to get some form of validation to download this game, you are clearly lost. This game has about 59M reviews on google play with an average of 4.0+. I don't think I really have to say anything other than it is a Top-down, RTS, resource management game with a focus on 1V1 or 5V5 or more PVP featurs with minimal PVE features. There aren't any crazy characters with cheat like abilities . Overall, a classic to try out on the Google Play Store!",4
I haven't played clash of clans in like six months. Now after fresh install of clash of clans when i go to login my supercell id i get verification code in email but after entering verification code 'opps! game account was not found' shows. I have tried many times but every time the verification code comes but I can't login. My email is correct but still unable to login. please help me Supercell😭😢,4
"The game is fun and been playing for years. But their support is absolutely horrible. Tried to recover a old base and they banned my account for 31 days for phishing, with no way to actually get in touch with anyone I can't try and get the situation sorted out because if I go through support with my same information I run the risk of a permanent ban. Reading into other people issues it surprise's me Supercell doesn't do better.",1
Honestly it's one the best mobile games ever. It's been 10 years since I've started playing this game and I never get bored with it. Sure it can get frustrating at times and you have to come up with new strategies all the time but that's what keeps you motivated to keep improving your village! 10/10 would recommend!,5
It's a really fun game I've been playing with my friends and the only downside is the amount of time it takes to upgrade or build and for a extra builder like a third cost $6.99 or a lot of work so only being able to use 2 builders is kinda annoying,4
"Many of u guys give low rating about this games because some of u guys feel it's difficult. But if u just knew wt to upgrade and build your village, this will be the best entertainment game ever . I am 17 it's still interesting for me . I used to get so frustrated in th lvl 4/5 , getting baloon/wizard itself was my great achievement at that tym . But, now it's totally different I understood how to build the village. So, it was easy for me now ....... Well keep it up Supercell 🔥🔥👍🏻👍🏻",4
"Had to take a few stars away the game like all games these days has plenty of ways to screw you over mainly your ai will do the dumbest stuff, like wander back and forth between two towers that are attacking you instead of attacking the resources that would leave you out of range of being attacked, or you will place your healers on a specific person and they just decide to leave that person and fly over the map to like a character you don't want them on but they won't even make it",3
"The game sucks. I have to build so many thing which costs millions and especially the walls, it costs so much for each wall and I've seen poeple have up to level 8 or 10 i don't know And this is the progress after 1 year first it seems fun but after that it gets very boring and wait hours or days until upgraded. Now im risking if i would delete this game, causing to delete my progress even thought i might never play this game ever again. I'm starting to dislike supercell's games.",1
"I love this game so much. Really passes time when your having a bad day, even whilst in a waiting room. The concept of the game is easy to learn and they update frequently. I would ask for a daily log in reward. Like an Elixr storage or a barrack. Really good game.",5
"Definetely your classic waiting game, but very strategic. It's not based on pure chance in battles, or who has more troops, but really on everything you do with them. Loving it so far! (kinda addicted)",5
"There is a serious issue in troop deployment and spell deployement. We need to tap more than once to select a troop or else the troop wont be selected. Ex. I was deploying the rage spell and then i clicked once and trying to deploy the freeze spell, instead of freeze the rage spell is deployed. This is especially in spell im facing this issue. This happend many times",1
I love this game...i have been playing this game from past 6 years.. But now after this new update when ever i try to open the game it donot load.. The bar did not move to complete it and the game never opens... My net work connection is also good...but i am not able to open this game because it is not loading its contents.. Kindly solve this issue...,3
"I have no idea what is going on with coc. whenever i opened my game and started the attack i couldn't see my troops. They were attacking but were invisible, archers and wizards on their towers were also invisible. And today, it got on my nerves. All the buildings from my base were invisible and only shadow could be seen. How am i supposed to attack in clan war leagues. I hope they focus on bug fixing too rather than on new updates. So many bugs in new update. I hate clash of clans very much",1
I like the games graphics and gameplay but I think the more you go on in the game the more it takes to upgrade buildings like the Xbow takes 2 days to upgrade 🕛 also it basically makes you want to click that builder pack I spent 20 damn dollars on this game the prices of the packs should lower a bit,4
"I like this game, been playing for about 6 years. The problems I have been facing is that there is no easy way to recruit clanmates, even discord server is not good enough. After banning global chat things haven't been the same. Second, matchmaking is worst, I get either pinch full of trophy bases with good loot of good trophies and fistful of resources. And about the global chat, if you are having problems handling reports then please you can add a disclaimer and leave it to the players.",3
"Crashes after the recent update. I trained Hog Gliders in Builder Base. And after that every time I try to open the game, it crashes after loading and showing a frozen builder base. I can't seem to access anything. I tried reinstalling and logged in to my second account and it worked fine. But main account is inaccessible.",5
"The game is AWESOME, love the clan capital and the raids medals we get. The game is fun and non addicting but one huge problem that I face- the game rarely loads. I try to open the game, the loading screen shows and the bar goes full, but then the screen just goes black. This repeatedly happens and I became tired of it so I had to uninstall the game. Hope you fix this issue so I can play the game again",2
"After 8 Years of playing this game, its still fun to come back to once in a while. The only thing that bugs me is the amount of time it takes to upgrade one building, the game has changed so much since the last time i played this and it stills the best game!",5
"My experience in this game has a lot of fun, but the only thing I hate about this game, is that I barely deploy my Troops near where the enemy's town hall are, and I keep freezing the air sweeper, etc. But my Troops didn't go directly I want them to go.",4
"I didn't rate 5 stars because it's hard to convince and recruit new players when we need more players, since there is no global chat for joining new clan. Also, I always get annoyed whenever dumb some trained troops for my next attack, and train other troops for donation. So what I mean is that it need to develop new training for only donation, separate from training troops for attack. Overall, well decent game and keep going!",3
"I can't open my account supercell locked it I always reaching supercell support but they don't help me I have the details and it was connected to my Gmail account but they don't give me my account disappointing game they locked accounts even it was connected to my Gmail ..Unfortunately, there is nothing else we can add to help you with this matter. If you have any questions about a different topic, you can contact us again after some time. Thank you. that message always they send...useless",1
"I really love this game, it's my stress reliever and at the same time my boredom reliever 😁 i enjoyed updating my stuff and attacking opponents 😁🤣. It's actually worth playing for since you have to be patient when upgrading one of your skill or armor. All in all, I rate this a perfect 5 star for the best experience I had!👏",5
"Nice game time spending. Please shorten the time and cost of upgrading the heroes, troops and building. Make it from days to hours, and from millions to thousands. Please free some settings like beach, park etc.",4
"I will suggest some things which should be upgraded 1) Voice chat (mic + speaker) that should be working while war atacks also. 2) Online syombol on players profile 3) If game crashes or internet disconnect after that we are not able to continue the attack, this thing should be fix. After that i am playing this game since 2015.",5
It is an amazing game there is not much more to say than the I love the art style and the gameplay overall I think it is one of my favorite games to play by you guys at supercell! Can't wait for the next update! (Oh and if you like the games by these guys try out clash royal),5
"The excellent strategy game that I have ever played. The only game that is not irritating much, while the progress is going on, when you are not paying. The only thing is you must have the patience to build up the village. Thank you! supercel.",5
"A good game to pull up in the morning I have been playing this game for a while and I have no complaints. A great original game, and it will always be good. Plus: no adds! Many great games are ruined by the massive amount of adds. Supercell is one of the few mobile game companies that isn't money hungry.",5
"I've been playing COC since 2013. I've had 5 bases and lost one at TH 10 when 10 was as high as COC went. A maxed out ten and along comes 11. I saw this wild expense was never ending. I spend a little now but mostly just attack. The Gold Pass is sweet to me. At least SC is giving back SOMETHING. No other war game is this good. I keep coming back. I'm still not a great attack man. The kids are amazing battlers. Best to all, Tony",5
"I remember playing this game as a kid and I must tell you, I never figured out how to get past townhall 4. Yet I played it until i until got older. Started again last month, and I've been speed running the game, but it's still as fun as it used to be. Even after this many years , it holds its place as the best strategy game. Great job devs.",5
"It's very realistic game ever seen in battle games.Everyday i play this game I am perfectly satisfied by this game play.But a small defect is that, The upgrdrading time of heroes is very high. Such only one level of Archer queen need 5 days for upgrading.we cannot use the queen because of these days. So plz reduce the upgrading thime heroes.",4
"This game is awesome . Sometimes , they can't bear us win so they prefer giving us tough opponents in versus battle . In multiplayer battle ,I love it , it is exciting to win 3 stars from a pro player ... that's all. But now the game starts to lag whenever I open it . I don't know why but I freakin hate it now",3
"Overall a fun game, many people dislike the fact that upgrade times and costs are very high but that is just the more realistic part of the game, not like most other city building games. One thing that I've noticed is that people have very different but very interuptive bugs, not often do people have the same bugs. The game is very strategic and it does take time to become good at it but there are many YouTube videos and tutorials to help with that. It also has some internet connection problems.",4
"It's a nice game but after some time it feels a bit boring. Like army takes very long time to be ready , upgrading things takes very long and very expensive, and the new sky thing is a bit hard .",3
i hate the game because the troops are so dumb and sometimes they don't behave well and you got to fix when players have a bad signal after finishing the 2020 challenge its such a waste when it was restart and im the first to experience it why did you restart the event all of the three star challenge was deleted and the items i got all dissapear all my time was wasted thanks to this game,1
Clash of clans is amazing I have been working on it for 4 years! All these years have had no bugs and they work so hard to make what is 100/100 to 1000/100 dont be rushed and work on making your base more upgraded. If you do that you get more experience and get a so much better base. Everyone will respect that. Get clash of clans and you wont be able to delete it,5
It was really a fantastic game where we can build our won town halls and the defense was really good and the strategies we make on the opponents is amazing during the clan war leagues we need to hold our nerves if the battle is going head to head and beautiful graphics and it was really easy to even the beginner's and the heroes and spells make the game more interesting and we can monthly play the clan games and nowadays we have even clan capital wars too just amazing game which I will recommend,5
"Horrible. Worsest experience from any gaming customer service. I used to play this game and i putt a lot of time and money in to this game. I stoped playing for while. ( did not have enough free time) i wanted to start playing again but i changed my phone 3 times after i stoped plaing so i lost my access. I asked customer service to help me but they instead of helping me they banned me for 31 days. How can i steal my own account i just don't get it. Horrible, horrible, horrible",1
"The game is fun and challenging I like it.. But i recommend to reduced the training/cooking duration of the troops, it's so boring to wait for an hour just to attack again.",4
"Best game to play forever. There are many changes occured in coc compared to older versions of coc like graphics , sound , etc . the clan capital , elixir free troops are the super features . the only drawback of this game is it takes a lot of time built or upgrade any building in higher town halls . it is the best game to play forever .",5
It's just an amazing game . I was playing it since 2015 and no doubt it's just improving continuously . But I think it is just going to be more cartoonistic like our marvel as it is replacing it's old character you are getting some more and new powerfull characters that's why we are forgetting our old troops which are not just troops they are emotions so please don't try to replace them . I am don't saying that don't get new troops it'syour job to do but try to improve our old troops stats thnx,5
"As always, I play and update Clash of Clans but this update does nothing but trouble for me. Every time I tried to open Clash of Clans, the game crashes and automatically exit the game. I don't know why this is happening to me or what is wrong with the game but I play it all the time and it's been a few days and the result is still the same. I hope you guys can fix this issue of mine because I have a headache for trying to fix it on my own.",3
Great farming game! It is very entertaining and enjoyable. Especially when you unlock your Builder Base and The Clan Capital. But I want 1 change. Can you lower the prices for unlocking different and unique hero skins? Although overall Is very phenomenal!,5
I really love this game . Me and my brother play this . But there is one small thing . How long the upgrades take . I am a kind of person who doesn't have patience. But my brother is fine with it . My brother has said that some of his upgrates have taken days (he's got town hall level 11 and me 7) overall great game there are always new challenges or games to do every month . And that would make us not bored of the game .,4
"Clash of Clans is a great, fun strategy game, but there's a thing that really frustrates me. When you have too many trophies, your village gets attacked almost instantly after you leave the game. As a result, bases with many trophies have shields most of the time, making the ‘Revenge’ button useless. I have a suggestion though: if the player hits the ‘Revenge’ button, the red message should display the duration of the defender's shield or guard instead of only showing that the shield is active.",3
good game.. but the app have bug. help and support not working. and you devs need to change some settings in war.. my defence win when i was below townhall7 .. but now failing always.. and the attackers are from townhall 9.how this happening.. like this if i search for fight me only get clan huge than my townhall level.. why happening these things.. so this is difficult for the players like me because need equal power enemies.. this is game rule... assume how level 1 and level 14 fight eachother,4
"This game is probably a 4 star game. However, it does feel like all the latest releases have just made my game crash more and more and now it is completely unplayable. Im on andoid 9 pie update and I just feel like COC doesn't run on it. I don't mind that supercell offer different scenery, BH and clan village but if they're added at the cost of making the base game unplayable for users on older android or IOS versions that is unacceptable.",1
"This game was so fun there's lots of stuff also, it its my favourite strategy game I've played over 2 years, this is the real thing, ive been started playing this game with my ex girlfriend until now we reach the max level together. This game give you some experience that you will never get on some mobile games, so what are you waiting for download it now",4
"I've been playing this games sinxe like forever, i like it but i don't know what's goikgn on lately it's kicking me out from the game everytime i try to attack a village or even just because and I've been losing trophies like crazy just because of it, it's not my internet , no matter where it's doing it everytime and I'm gettin tired of it",3
"Game is good but upgrading all the weapons, troops and town hall it takes more time to upgrade all of that waiting waiting from past 7 years became fed up atleast uninstalled it. Very very lazy game in upgrading it will take more time untill the user feel fed-up and uninstalled it like me. Upgrading own home town hall only dieing to upgrade still the game is upgrading by giving extra 3 stupid town hall. The reason Every user who stopped playing this game becoming fed up by waiting waiting to upg",1
"Pretty fun until each Building, Army Troop & Spells takes 7-12 days too upgrade (Th11+) it's a fun game, very distinct. But man it does take a Loooong time too upgrade Anything once Th11+. Also, no one knows about O.T.T.O, like he's a hidden builder. I feel like setting up more goals from BuilderBase-to-TownHall would be cool🤙🏻. (Maybe a goal task list?) But in conclusion, this is a 1-of a kind game and will be my favorite mobile game & has been sense I was 14(I'm 21 now) CapitalHall is Great!",5
It's been a great journey with coc but After the latest update I'm facing graphical problems like I can't see part of my buildings and also when I'm attacking I can't even see the troops I evacuated. The other thing is it's very sad that there is no one single African national country flag in the decoration field so I say they better work on those matters as fast as they can....,2
"I love coc no complain. This is grindable but the way the troops get placed in the match. I will change this to 5 STARS For one thing only.............. If you place troops to shoot at a tower, and they don't shoot at the tower that's shooting at them and instead shoot something with a huge pool of health till there are no troops there....... We got a problem. From now on. Plz make the troops respond to being attacked like COMMON SENSE.",2
"Been playing for a lot of years on and off. Over lvl 100 now. Best game in play store if you ask me. Always new aspects...I THINK BEING ABLE TO DOUBLE UP OUR BUILDERS ON ONE TASK WOULD BE AN AWSOME ADDITION TO THE GAME. lol high lvl bases take WEEKS. I have noticed some clan members disappear after a week long upgrade. They forget about the game. Faster upgrades at high lvl= higher participation= more money in COC pockets. Feel free to throw me a job offer, I might bite! Love you bye",5
"Been playing CoCs since 2014 and love it. Devs, could you look to add a feature that can show who has contributed to each individual upgrade in the clan capital? Very frustrating when your clan agrees on how we will progress with upgrades, but some players are upgrading things you want to leave for now, and you don't know who is doing it.",5
It won't stop crashing now. It loads then immediately a black screen and crashes constantly. Used to only crash in the middle of my battles but now I can't even get that far.,1
"I love this game but i have some problems on this games. The problem is my loot cart says it has 4,000,000 elixir and golds and when i collect it the game will crash i tired it over and over but the it will still crash please fix this so i can collect my original loot cart. Thank you",4
"Great gameplay! Unfortunately, it's been years playing this game since the buggy jelly bean & Google play. Hardcore players slowly diminishing. Noob players mostly rushers dominating. I'am the only one playing on my circle then they saw me playing they said ""still playing???"". Need to loot daily because resources collected can't catch up. The former 2-4 hour guard and 12-16 hour shield making twice a day looting is gone. Clan games, season challenges & troop events is great! I've maxed out BB9!",5
"I think this game needs a setting so that if any update is finished then a selected building will start upgrading automaticly if there are enough resources that will cost.The reason is sometimes players cannot open the game in time because of thier busyness.So, they lost their too much time and can't make faster progress of thier village.But if the settings come,players will be able to develop their village minimum 2×faster.Please,do this.",4
My favourite game because it's and challenging and does not have any ads. This game became even better if you lower the prices of skins of heroes and packs of th. This game is really fun and love to play this game. Thanks supercell to create such an amazing game. There are so many things to do in this game. If you haven't tried it yet pls go check it out. It's my favourite game because of these things.,5
"I like the game alot but still I have to say the builder base matchmaking sucks,it's not giving you an equal or fair matching, almost everytime I have been batteling against an opponent far superior to me so they have a lot of defense that i dont so it's not a fair fight because we don't even have a skip option in builder base fight",4
"Best mobile game in history! I'm not surprised that over 500 million people plays it. It's a really nice every day game, you just log in daily, collect your stuff and do some battles. My one friend is free to play and still loves the game! (He's TH 11 without rushing). Btw Clash of Clans is even better with the new update where you can train troops without using any of your resources! Thx Supercell!!!!!!",5
"This Game is life. It's nostalgic, the memories, the clan war planning with friends in school, the excitement of going home to have an upgraded barrack so I can finally train a pekka, I can go on. But i wont. I am glad I grew up with this and not Pubg or free fire, planning strategies in class and not imagining guns in my hands and shooting everybody in class.",5
Expensive experience of clash of clans is the best like you can make an army make a face and all that stuff it's the best game I ever played ever like it's crazy and if you you can make clans meet new people and all of that simple just start just learn the basics and boom it's easy there's 14 levels and there's all kinds of bass and trophy war trolls if you want to throw people that's easy to do,5
"This game is full of strategies to play with, for example farming resources, trophy pushing and etc. I've I've playing this game for years now and I don't regret downloading it, after reading the comments I am deeply confused, There are no bugs and no wifi problems, keep the good work up supercell! P.S just a suggestion, I would love to have a feature that allows you to attack your own base so it would be easier for base designers to build a perfect base. In conclusion this is a great game!",5
I like the game. But when I attack in night the defender is always higher and strong base from me. I cant push trophies in night. I would like u to fix the bug. And if it works I will give 5 stars.,5
"Great game and ive been playing it for years, there are a few minor things such as war matchups. I think we should be able to choose what we want to fight in some way that way its not completely uneven especially in clan war league. Also in clan capital the leader and maybe co leaders should be able to highlight upgrades so that everyone knows to donate to that. Also if we could do the opposite to some upgrades and hide them. One last thing, could co leaders and leaders have a donationlog.Game👍",5
"It was fun, until the last update came. After the update, every time I click on the events and news section, my game freezes and crashes after a few moments. For that reason, I reinstalled the game after uninstalling it. After opening the game, everything was normal until the 'Downloading Content' came. I thought it was normal and after a wait for few minutes I realized the 'Downloading Content' is infinite. It was sending me to the 'Supercell' screen back and forth. Please fix this.",1
"High training cost used to be the dragon's biggest counter, now you remove the training cost from the game. So now, literally every attack you get is all dragons and nothing else. It's so rare to get attacked with ground troops nowadays. If you're going to remove training costs then you need to add new hard counters for dragons and pekka who had their high training cost as the biggest discouragement of spamming them.",2
I have lost five accounts with clash of clans. They make it almost impossible to recover. One account I had for over 2 years and was well developed. I had to reset my phone and lost all my information. That was 5 years ago and I'm still trying to recover it. Supercell support is no support at all. They take forever to respond and then they don't notify you once they have responded. Causing you to have to restart the whole process over again. I used to love this game now I can't stand it.,1
"After the last update the game sometimes automatically shuts down in the middle of an attack! And in legend league where you only have 8 attacks per day, it hurts ! Fix this bug please it is so disappointing and discouraging",1
"It's quite fast paced until u hit Town Hall 9 on the main village I found it the most lengthy town hall of most, it surely did bore out the experience of progression but overall it's really nice! I'm still playing and I love it! Do recommend.",5
It's an amazing game.... Great to play but i am facing too many problems while loading. It sometime just open blank or with black screen and this is making my phone working slow. Please correct the bugs.,2
Best game ever in my life. I am playing this game and i can test my amazing designs to build up my own village and i have fantastic ideas to build up my own strategy. I given 4 stars 1 i didn’t gave because I can add any friend but I can't chat with them so adding friend is useless. I can chat in clan but we can't chat with someone about personal things. So please make a way that we can chat in private chat with our friends. Its my request please do it.,4
"Now I'm giving 2 stars to this game becoz after this game loaded it automatically come out of this game after few seconds when I'm in war, clan capital raid or in builder hall loot most of the times it affects my war while I'm raiding in it...... I have installed and reinstalled many times.. but it isn't working....So please fix this issue ..... Is this really a bug or not please reply me ...... I'm playing this game for 2 years....I really love this game ❤️",5
"Been playing for 10 years and still play daily so if that doesn't explain how great clash is then nothing does. My opinion is that supercell is by far the best mobile game developers because I've played coc, royale and brawl for yearssss!!! I don't even play games on my console like that its just crazy to think how pixels on a screen can influence our mood and take our attention for years",5
"This game is very satisfying and rewarding for me, to enjoy it you need to have strategy and patience-extreme patience. It's very simple and user-friendly. I've seen updates here and there and I can say they have really improved over the years. Keep up the Good work Supercell 🙌",5
I've been playing this game on and off now for five years and a recent update causes it to completely freeze even after you delete everything and log back in. I have a clan to run and now I can't even get on to do that and people are probably wondering where I've been for the past couple days please fix this immediately if not for anyone who's reading this I wouldn't bother it's not working,2
"An addictive multiplayer game. Plenty to do. Purchases actually punished by unbalancing player development. Only purchase worth having is the £4.50 monthly gold pass. But even that is not necessary to enjoy playing. Have been playing for about 10 weeks now and can see why some friends have been playing for years. Only problem is the ongoing connection issues, which have got to be a major pain after latest content upgrade.",5
"All nice but there is a major glitch, during any attack whenever the internet connection runs out, the attack will stop where the connction is lost...They should give either a re-attack or reconnect it to the attack when the connection got lost. Plz Supercell, Fix it.",3
"Great game but they ruined it when they removed global chat. They didn't replace it with any functioning system to find clan mates. The 'looking for' is a joke, only people of other nationalities and people with a clan or full inbox show up. Almost impossible to find the most fundamental thing in this game and that is clan mates. If they were to fix this I would have no complaints. (Except let us use heroes in war when upgrading)",1
"I know this is a huge request and some might agree or disagree on this. I feel like it would be an amazing thing being able to swap between our current army and our already fully prepared army whose training time was complete, or make us have 2 different sets we can either choose from(ofcourse already training time being complete for both) and let us swap between them in battle and adter one is used we would have to either wait for their training or just go in with the 2nd for next battle",5
"An amazing game love the upgrades still not comfortable with the builders slow upgrades of different things but still, great game it's so much fun and the graphics are amazing and everything is just right.",5
"The consistency of the new interesting features makes it very fun and addictive. You can't just get enough because you will want to continue playing until your gadget battery drains. Clash of Clans is my best game ever, have been playing it for over 6 years now. Fun lovers this is your Fun Reality",4
"it's a wonderful, BUT please just cause I'm in a higher league, that's champions league don't mean I should not see my fellow town hall level to attack 😐 enough with seeing Town Halls a level or 2 levels higher than me, for sure there are many of my fellow town hall to attack in the league I'm in but why not show me? It's vexing how I'll be finding a match for minutes and not find any of my fellow Town Hall then be forced to attack a higher level in some instances I lose,please FIX IT😠😤",4
This game would be perfect if it didn't take 9plus days to upgrade something. You should offer more builder potions or take time off the building upgrades it is so fun but It is insane that we have to wait that long!,3
"The app won't stop crashing since the new update. I even tried uninstalling the app, reinstalling it, restarting my phone, and turning my phone off and back on. It still crashes when I get logged into my account! FIX THIS!!! Do you not want people to play?!?!",1
"I completed the most recent update on my tablet and now can no longer open the game. I have powered off and on I have uninstalled reinstalled, I have deleted unused apps to open space for the game no fix. It's a Kindle fire tablet. If this keeps up I may stop playing I don't like the game on my phone.",4
This is a great game if you want something you come back to everyday for a little while and put away. You can play that way and not spend any money. And the battles are strategic so it feels like a deep strategy game after awhile.,5
"Great strategy game that stays fun over the course of time (I've been playing for 6 or so years.) It is a game that takes time, but even at lower levels you can have fun as you build up to the higher levels. Matches are scaled by your current level and so the challenges will always be equal to what you can do. It doesn't mean it's easy, it does take strategy, but it does mean that it can be done. This also means that there is no pay to win as you're always matched equal to your strength.",5
What happening today 1 pm IST after. I open the game it will closeautomatically. Itrued more than 50 times same happened. Its so annoying and i reinstall the game still its doing the same open and close automatically. someone look at this.,1
A friend urged me to come back after a long break. In a nutshell: Supercell took a great game and ruined it. TH14 gameplay is wretched and absolutely painful. You really expect players to be able to manage 300 housing space and 4 heroes?? CWL still has zero balance and there is no incentive to do anything with the clan capital unless you are completely maxed out. And the worst part? Still no update of any kind to the builder base literally years after BH9 was released. Garbage!,1
"Constantly crashes. Takes 6 or more attempts to get in the game, then crashes when you press anything. This issue started a few months ago and has not been fixed.",1
This is one of the best games I've played and I would've gave it a five star but there is 1 big issue that makes me lower it to a 3 star. It is so unfair to the OG players that played the game. Since all the buildings and walls have become cheaper all the OG gamers grinding for resources for their walls and then all of a sudden everything has become cheaper and you have just lost half a million loot on a wall. Supercell please give some sort of refund to OG players since it's so unfair to the OG,3
I would like to point out despite having 4 barracks only 1 troop trains at a time I know previously that u had to click each barrack individually to train troops and that saved time but them all being linked but only training 1 at a time is annoying and makes so you only want to upgrade 1 barrack and leave the others alone I would like this minor issue fixed please,4
"I hate the the latest update update about arcade not because it's a bad game but it has a very small control which I can't press, it's really bad Update: The 10th years anniversary arcade games controls are sooooo bad I can't play it, the games looks so fun but the controls ruin everything :(",1
"This is the best strategy game on play store.if u are looking for a game that will last for a while longer then COC is for u.it packs nice and awesome 👍 😎 graphics ,excellent and smooth gameplay.there is just not stopping at what supercell as brought to Mobile.as battle pass comes with awesome rewards. update coming in a balance rates. maintenance break coming from time to time. game progress can also be saved to there personal cloud server.security patches so good.no bud or hack can slip in",5
Op op op!!! Simply good and mind-blowing. I've been with my friends and it's awesome! But nowadays the find a match in online mode is a pain in the butt. It gives us players of townhall 4 or 3 to play?!!,5
the troops was good the deffense buildings are nice the battle field is cool but the upgrading process was to long especially to the troops spells and to the workshop! . i suggest to have 3 laboratory 1 for troops 1 for spells 1 for workshops. so that the upgrading process will be fast .. so that the players will be active in looting because the upgrading process is faster than enough i hope it well notice my suggestion😊😊😊,5
"The game is extremely fun once you learn the gameplay loop of attack to gain loot, then upgrade over and over. Thing is that works until about Townhall 8 or 9 and that will keep you busy for about a year. Once you hit Th 10 or higher, it has almost become work to maintain intrest because the wait times to upgrade and train troops to attack takes to long. (Builder base is the best in app solution but that only counts for the first 3 successes. Then it pointless to be on the base.)",4
"started to play again , had some progress with my village ,bought some gems as well. Change my phone ,reinstall reload the game progress then I was instantly brought back to were I started. All progress were gone . Effort and money turns to waste wont be playing again .",1
"Its been a long time coming. I have been playing coc from a long time but never rated it, always tapped ""later"" on the prompt asking me to rate the game. But well what better time to give it 5 stars then when we are celebrating the 10th anniversary. Thank you coc, you have been an amazing part of my childhood and still are today. Lots of love and best wishes ❤",5
"Hey I'm a player of this game since 2013. Never have I ever had any complaints about it, it's addictive and fun! I've been obsessed with it since I was little. But with the new update, I was too excited and after I updated the game, my game would automatically crash if I click the clan capital at first. And when I tried to fix it, I couldn't even load my home village. Idk what's happening but it would be helpful if you look into the above matter. PS: I've reinstalled the game about 5 times now.",2
"Bring back the old Gameplay, new Update make everything more easy, no challange at all, making troops free its worst. Return the old clash of clans by adding back Traps replacing cost, lower resources bonus, Cost for training troops and Nerf for few type of unit. The gameplay is become boring if you make everythign too easy, also Remake of model skin to make it more realistic is good thing instead adding more skin.",2
"This game is amazing!. I had left this game since 2016-2017 And I had installed this yesterday again, and it looked like my village was somehow mistaken me as a goblin... I had to fight my own village with my own troops, lol. I had Infinite troops or you could say reinforcement like every 10 second, I had won of course. Then I found out that my village was maxed out of the town hall ""7"", I didn't expect this game to have this kind of feature. Big thanks to super cell!",5
"This game is really great and I love it but the only problem I have is that whenever I try to play the game, it kicks me out of the loading screen for some reason. I use an android device and whenever there are notifications or any background apps running, it kicks me out. I have disabled notifications and closed my background apps and it sometimes just doesn't work. Please fix this and I might rate it a 5 stars.",4
"Best game to ever hit the mobile game store. I am a returning player. The game is simple yet hard at the same time. Even if you don't like progressive leveling or strategy games, you need to give this game a try!!!!",5
I have played coc for over 10 yrs and have enjoyed it both as a game and as a means to connect with family members across the generational divide and who live in different parts of the country. While playing I have met and made friends with a great many individuals in Different parts of the world. There is the temptation to spend money but you don't have to if your patience and have other things to do in life. A great game that is constantly improving.,4
I like the game I would of given it 5 stars but it's just when you upgrade your town hall or anything in general that you have on a high level it sometimes takes days to finish and it's very hard for the free to play players because they can't just buy gems to buy more builders so in my opinion the game is very pay to win,4
"Came back to the game after about a year break and then I play it for one day only while on break at work, and withing 6 minutes of playing on my lunch break when I've literally barely done anything I get kicked out of the game for a ""personal break."" And then I have to waste half of the lunch break I get waiting for the game to allow me to play, screw this I'm unistalling it again, waste of space for a game",1
"Supercell never lets us down. Amazing and addictive game with very few flaws. The only thing I would change about it is the Gems. The quest system and the gem mines are a decent way of getting them, but a new builder's hut requires 500? Either make a new way of getting gems easily or just make it cost coins or elixir. Otherwise, great game!",5
All of a sudden this is the only app that won't open I go to open it and it just goes back to the app screen. I've been playing this game for 10 years great game was playing it last night now all of a sudden late last night and this morning I can't log on. I did all the restarts I did everything except uninstall which after 10 years of playing I don't want to do,1
Perfect game I was looking for at least till May 2022. But now you have done free army training which makes game more easy which I don't like. The old way in which you have to spend elixer to train army was better. I request you to please change this.,5
"This was a fun game, if you lose your rank and try to get it back your in for a wild ride. I was one of 5 clan leaders for the clan I was in. One day I found my rank was set to zero, I had lost everything earned over a few years of daily playing. Customer support was a horror show. I had to keep providing them with more and more information which i did only to have them ban me for as they put it attempting to steal someone's account. These guys suck, and I will never play this game again.",1
"This game is really fun! There's lots to it and no ads. It gets harder as u upgrade everything. EVERYTHING runs smoothly, if not ur wifi is probably not working. U can meet friends and more etc.",5
The best game ever it's really fun to play when you bored and it's just so amazing but the only problem is that something take forever to upgrade and you have to upgrade your castle to get more stuff that's just annoying but otherwise it's a good game and I love it so much.,5
Since few days back whenever I attack for loot my connection gets disconnected although my network is stable then I end up loosing my trophies and also my troops gets wasted without me not getting any loot... Please fixed this issue .. I have been an active player since 4 years back ..Also I am demoting my ratings to this game .,2
"It's some work to max out, (which is not always a bad thing), and it's just a chill game to play to pass the time real quick, ya feel 😎🤌😏👌 Just don't leave the app for a while when your in the middle of fighting someone else's base (or writing out a rating for the app), you might lose the reward (that's on meee 👉🤚👉🤙)",4
"Super fun game, I've been playing since 2015 and I've never had a problem with this game but now it freezes everytime I login and the whole game crashes, which is really annoying and frustrating.",1
"The game is awesome. It's just that after the latest update, the matchmaking gets bad. I have always been match to a +1 TH higher than me. In war it would be ok, my team can help me. But it is the same with multiplayer and builder hall. So it gets hard to farm and win now.",3
"the game is not bad, but the most frustrating problem starts after a few weeks. you get attacked by higher level players every day and you have not a single chance defending. that wants you to keep up the def shield and you dont participate in pvp anymore... i am about to delete the account soon, too unbalanced pvp.",2
"All good but stop adding more townhalls cuz even though the grinding is much faster and easier than it used to be, still we only got one lifetime, and only so much of our time to dedicate to one game. This is by no means a complaint but only my observation. I realize maxed out accounts would run out of things to do but they have the clan capital now.",5
"Its a great game other than, the storage it takes up from all the updates its still a great game. But if you ask me how to play I will say I'm only a town hall level 8 and I'm only been playing for two years. Anyway you should really check clash of clans out. But I can't find my verification code from supercell so if supercell does read this please send it .",5
"Hi Supercell, Your game deserves 5 stars. But the reason is I neet to switch my email in Supercell ID. But their is no option. I tried opt out of but it doesn't work. Games like call of duty provide us option to change email. Kindly please add official option for changing email address. Then I surely give it 5 stars. I am an old player. Thanks",1
Needs less waiting time but it is a good game and every time after the new update every time I try to change accounts it freezes when it is about to go in to the game. It maybe just my connection tho.,4
This is an amazing game really fun to play if you want a game that has so much strategy into it this is the game for you the only reason I didn't rate this a 5 stars is because upgrades take so much time like some upgrades take days so its really annoying to wait because I don't wanna spend any gems but overall really good game for a game that has been around for 10 years.,4
"The gameplay is smooth and flawless, furthermore, the graphics are stunning and the whole idea behind this game is great. It is balanced and well designed. (Waiting for TH15)",5
everytime I go to purchase something the app keeps crashing. I tested this on some other apps to see if it's my phone but all of them work fine. Other than that the game is still amazing,3
"Love the game, but they used to show me how much a set of troops would cost me in quick train and I'm really missing that feature. I hope they bring that back because the guesswork on costs isn't fun when trying to be precise",4
"It's not good for me because i played this game for continuous 5 years and grew up my clan to level 12 but suddenly due to some work i lacked playing this game for about 6 months, when i logged in recently my leadership was given to some other guy in clan and all my hardwork seemed to be waste. Even sometimes the verification code doesn't even arrive For 1 whole day... We must get another option too, like password or else some backup codes..",1
"Clash of Clans is a fun strategy game. In this game you need to train troops (like dragons, wizards etc...)and use those troops to attack enemy basses. It's fun when you are planning war attacks with your friends/clan mates. New update made game much more fun beacuse it's way easier to try new army compositions beacuse you don't need to use a lot of elixir/dark elixir",5
This game is good and all One thing i hate about this game is that there no waiting for reconect like when i changes my data to wifi it just restart the game and sometime when i raid an enemy the reload button randomly pop and the game reload i lost a trophy and some troops I hate this so much so please supercell fix this,2
BEST EVER GAME but SUPERCELL please report about copied apps like clash of titans 1and 2 make something like a base password using which someone can go to another base because if you dont sign in then your base gets lost my base also got lost i dont want this to happen with someone else. I gave it 1 one because as soon as it opens it just crashes,1
"Just like everyone else, my game also keeps crashing , it loads and there is my home village and it just crashes again, this has been happening for around a day now, just after the recent troop cost upgrade, first i couldnt install the update and after i have installed it finally the game keeps crashing",1
Enjoy the base building but this game really is a PAY TO WIN game. It's about %40 strategy and %60 upgrading. The leveling and matchmaking is not balanced. They'll always be a stronger level that defeats your base no matter how good your strategy is.,3
New update causes the game to crash right after loading. Uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing worked. I've been playing this game for 7 years. Hope this isnt the end,1
My experience has been great in this game especially because all of my friends have it and we're in the same clan so in a way it's also somewhat challenging between us too because we always want to be number one in the clan and have competitions and some play everyday which also pushes the clan. It's a good game and i only reviewed cause every second you want me to review but it's nca though. If you looking to be in a clan with your friends and grow together this is for you and don't be toxic.,5
"Hello developer teams of c.o.c , it's an honour to play c.o.c now, but i think the past is more good than now (after updated) where the training army is not free but use our elixir&dark elixir... We should use it because we have no idea what we gonna do with it. The storage is always full because of the new updated, it caused my base got attacked more and of course i lose my trophy. It's all",5
"I'm not sure why but the game crashed for the first time. I got on, upgraded a spell with book then troop with book then started same troop then crash. I was also using boost for lab at the time. I didn't lose anything in the process though. Very great game! The loot update not so sure dark elixir has no purpose now. Just kinda sits there until hero or something is finally upgraded. I also noticed I don't get dark elixir in clan castle with 5 star attacks. Or gold pass, What gives??At TH10 :)",5
It's not the best game because you may have to wait days and maybe just weeks just to get a single upgrade but with all the troops and upgrades it's fun to attack and defend your base so I would really recommend this time and strategy game.,3
When ever I open my game after 20-25 sec it get crashed. A notice is appered that I have losen the internet connection. But when I use other apps the network connection is stable. I am having this prblm from last 2-3 days.,2
"1. ""SOLDIER TRAINING TIME IS STILL AROUND"" makes this game very boring. I don't have time for that. 2. One more problem that is also very important is the problem of donating soldiers to each clan player which is also ineffective and consumes players' time. These two things shouldn't exist. Players should be able to fill their own clan without waiting for the help of other players and without using medals. Army training time should be removed. Because these two things really interfere the game.",1
Very well designed and crafted game. A must have if your into designing your own base and creating your own army. Absolutely love the game! Never gets old. NOTE: Money is not required to enjoy this game. But I do highly recommend the gold pass which is $5 a month.,5
"Good game, alot of fun really enjoy playing You can pay money but by no means do you have to, with a little time and practice your base will be holding its own against veteran players Its been going for ten years so there's a huge online community for hints strategies, base layout download sites. I do pay for the gold pass just under £5 a month which I think is quite reasonable, to get extra spells/gold hero skins, helps keep the game ad free plus new content and I play every day, brilliant game",5
"This by far is the best supercell game but there are two problems. When ur around th10 that's when the upgrade times always take a few days. Second problem, why r walls so expensive, I'm th9 and I can't afford walls, even after 5m season bank loot.",4
"In order for us to help, make sure to contact us from the within the game, this way we’re able to locate your village/base/farm and identify details of your device. Please head over to your game’s settings, enter the “Help” section, and then write to us in whatever category applies to your issue. Sent 3 emails telling supercell it is frozen after up and cannot access game just opens and then force stops this needs to be fixed asap",1
"Supercell, your help and support is not useful at all. It's not responsive, I had bought this season's gold pass and still after 24 hours of the purchase I haven't received my purchase also my money got debited in a second. Where should I go to contact you? How things can be put right? I need may gold pass and your improved help and support for the players.",5
"I have stayed with this game for a very long time and i plan on staying with it. Its fun and not too p2w. I have played this game since the traps in the game had to be rearmed. I am to scared to try and use new strats to bust enemy bases but its alright, because the game alows you just to farm, but rewards you nicely if you attack. Also joining a clan can be great thanks to clan games, clan wars, the clan capital, and clan war perks. All around this game is a 5 star.",5
The game is a goodtime pasing because its fun and war and many challenges in the game and time limit in upgrade. And the game play with my friends in clan and push groly of clan and pushing tropies this is because it is a good game I love it so much thanks for readingmy note ...❤❤❤❤❤,5
"I was trying to get my account back and they banned me for 31 days. I haven't played for 1 to 2 years and now I really don't want to play clash of clans anymore because of that. Just because I kind of forgot what device I played on last, Like this so dum. Plus the support page took soooo long just to get someone to help me. If i can get help here it would be great.",3
"I love the game. Unfortunately, I couldn't see who are active in my clan and how many minutes, hours, or days the last time they open. If the clan features is like a messenger where we could see those active or not. I will change 3star to 5star. Since, the global chat isn't available anymore. I wish for more interaction at least in the clan where we reside. Thank you for your time and I love the game so much despite the star.",3
Made a purchase and didn't receive what I ordered. They said I did but I didn't.... I guess their server is perfect and never makes mistakes. Oh well. Clash at your own risk just beware if you make a purchase and dont receive it that you won't get a refund. The mods know all and are never wrong 🤣,1
"Coc officials please look into that matter immediately.......now the troops are free of cost.... Now its easy to upgrade buildings....thats very good....but in TH9 it takes approx 1 month to max the TH9 buildings but the heros will be low..If we make sure to max everything, we will have to wait another 1.5/2 months to max our heros only....because other buildings will be maxed out by 1 month..queen goes from lvl-1 to lvl-30....thats a big jump. PLEASE BALANCE THIS TH9 SITUATION.",4
"Whenever my network connection went off during war attck it consider the attck is completed what type of this system is this they should keep a backup or something which doesn't count that attck. Please fix this issue , This has already been happened to me many times.",2
"Updates lately have suxed, keyboard hanging up since maintenance break it wouldn't let anyone in clan hit some bases at all they really need to get it together and didn't get my clan games rewards for July because of a update every time they update it makes a bunch of bugs and glitches no home update in 6 months or more everyone is losing interest because of this, I've played for years but last year and this year 2022 has suxed",3
"Best game ever . There are a lot of strategic games , but coc is one of the best . Play with your friends or make new one . In coc strategy, gameplay, the looks and feel of it is the best in it catagory. Definitely u should try it . Well all of my friends play it together and also have a clan . So what r u waiting for . Download it right now 👍✨",5
Took a long time to make legion league but I made it 😁 great for time to go by quickly after I tried to update it wouldn't allow me back everything was frozen took Over a day trying to figure out a way to contact sup port without being allowed into my village finally I was sent another upgrade to get back in in the meantime I lost 200 trophies and got demoted .,5
"Pretty great and fun game, trophy gain and loss should a set amount based on the levels of town hall attacking, defending, and percent/star damage. I also think that you should be able to buy clan castle reinforcements should you not be in a clan or need to attack when no one else in the clan is on.",4
"Hey cOc ... am playing this game since very long time and ... But after the latest updation, am not able to play as it always get crashed and screen goes black.. error showing unable to run the application.. Please fix it fast",1
Although the whole gaming experience is awesome but I just get irritated sometimes by the upgradation time of buildings as this time increases as you keep upgrading the stuff... All the wait is quite frustrating 😑 That's why I gave 4 stars otherwise this game deserves a 5 star review 😁,4
"Bad! i had Town Hall level 9 and a lot of progress and after the update, the game stopped working anymore!!! it crash with black screen everytime i try to get in Fix that Please.",1
"Mostly fun, but the AI for many of the characters is a bit stupid. ""This thing won't hurt me unless I stand up against it, let's run up & stand next to it while I attack a nearby structure!"" 🙄",4
"I have been playing clash of clans for years. I haven't played any other game for as long as I have played clash of clans. I have spent over 50$ on clash of clans. Until the summer update I would have given clash of clans 5 stars without a doubt. However, the recent change to remove troop training cost has ruined this game for me. 1. There is no reason to use farming armies. 2. Troop cost reduction events are now impossible 3. Elixir an already abundant resource has been made easier to obtain.",1
"One of the best games. But one thing that I don't like is that after the update, you have set the limit of highest level for donation depending upon our clan castle level. It's not good, as if we can receive troops of our clan castle level, then what would be the advantage of staying in a strong level clan. Eg: if I have electro of 3rd level, but I have to donate someone but he has limit of only 1st level, then my 3rd lvl electro will become lvl 1 electro while donating. Pls remove this limit.👍",5
It is a good game but there is no option for Android or small resolution phones for 2 bar troops deployment..... Yes in ipad and android tab you can choose 2 bar troops deployment but you can't do it in small resolution phones like iphone ( any series) or Android phone ( like any android phone) please make an option for that 2 bar troops deployment..... Thank you....,3
This is one of the best game for phones. But day by day this game is dying. I don't see many attempts from the developer to prevent this. You can add more country flag to make this game interesting again to the ex-player. Also you can add some cultural events/festival to the game. Like it is Bangla new year here in Bangladesh. If you added something about Bangla New Year to this game many player would start to love this game again.,5
"Unbelievably magnificent, a simple game yet a strong strategy. Took years to master and conquer all strategies. Beautiful journey of joy and patience. The real definition of a ""from zero to hero"" game. The cute design yet a complex strategies to be combined from denfence and attacking. This game is worthy in the hall of fame",5
"I wasnt thinking much of it,until i played it.It truly is one of the Best games of Supercell. For all of you who like building bases and armies,etc. its just the best game.It runs so smooth in your device and feels really light,thats a huge advantage! Its a supercell game,so that means a lot of grinding of course but its not a pay to win game and it has the awesome quality of supercell s games.",5
"Honest Opinion. MAKE FARMING AND UPGRADES EASY.. Taking weeks and months to upgrade a single item is so wrong. It used to be a good game but now all the fun is gone. If the content was more of ""Clashes of clans"" then it might have survived.",3
"Worst Versus battles/wars in builder hall encountered in COC. My BH troops (even boosted) of same level can't beat opponent's defence; but opponent's same level troops easily beat my defence. A 3 min battle/war makes me winner & adds 28 to 30 trophies into my BH Acc., then the very next war takes away same no. of trophies as I lose. After 20+ battles, my Builder Hall trophy score is still same. Pathetic strategy game 🤬🤬🤬",1
"Love it. It is so much fun and even though all you have to do is check on it every few hours be ause the upgrades start to take longer, it is still fun to attack people while I'm waiting for something to finish. You should get it it's really a lot of fun. And alo the only game on the play store that has no ads, or just maybe very rare ads.",5
"Excellent game but I would like to suggest something, there should be clock tower boost in home village too because it takes so much time to upgrade anything. I'm tired of it",4
"Changed my review to 5 stars. The summer update broke Clash so I could not play. They fixed it within a day. It was annoying it happened in the middle of an event, but stuff like that happens.",5
"There is something wrong with this update. After doing a Builder Base attack, COC crashed going back to my home base. I have tried everything to get back up, including uninstallng, rebooting the computer and re-installing COC, to the same crash, as soon as it loads...",5
This was my favorite game growing up and I stopped playing for a year and I come back and they give me boost for everything but when I signed back in the next day they telling me I cant play due to personal break like what? And I've waited the whole day to try again for the same message so all the boost are going to waste for no reason at all when I didnt play for long,1
"I am in a very big problem right now i lost my account today. I just redownloaded it the next i deleted and now when first i wrote my id it said game account not found. And then i tried just playing without supercell id and retrying it but then when I logged in, it was logged in to town hall 1 account and even i tried about 8 times to login back to my previous account but all tries failed even the support isn't helping at all. It was a town hall 10 account and i don't wanna lose it. Pls fix this",1
"It's a good game that i have been playing for a while now. The only problem? It disconnects you in the middle of an attack or worst when your attacking for clan wars and when it gets you disconnected then you lose stars/trophies. My internet is fast but somehow this app says i have a bad connection. It's not my phone or an update on the app. If they can fix this, it's a 5 no doubt.",1
"Please fix the crashing, this game is great but when I keep launching it, it keeps crashing, I've played it before without any problems but up to now, it just crashes.",3
"I started playing this strategy game on 2016, I've known all of the changes made of this Game. Until now, it makes me sad when thinking back those days when Global Chat's still there. But until now I'm still playing this with the same feelings of excitement 😉 this is one of my stress reliever tbh. Keep up the good work supercell👏",5
"Town hall 12 needs a massive nurf, the wardens pathing is insanely stupid. Also legends league is just really bad you can't play competitively solely because you aren't a th13-14. The air troops in clan capital all need a massive buff, too. It just gets seriously annoying. Supercell rarely updates the game, but they've still never balanced out the game well.",1
Heroes seem to only go around the outside of the base instead of the path you open for them. This has only been a problem since the last update. Great game but every update makes it worse.,3
"1)Why is there no flag of Somalia 🇸🇴 in the list of flags that are bought and placed . 2)After the last update, the training of armies is free and it means that we don't use elixir and dark elixir. This is useful but for the dark elixir it has accumulated there are not many things that I can do with dark elixir it was difficult to collect in the past but now it is accumulating.",3
Clash of Clans is a good experience. You can create your own base and destroy other bases (that base will revive itself).It is a Strategy game like Age of Empires. I like this game but it would also be cool 😎 to put your own soldiers in your treasury so you wouldn't depend on your Clanmates or be in a clan.,5
"Incredible game just a classic, and the new updates are amazing, I love the pace of the game not too slow to where you're waiting ages for upgrades, but slow enough for you to have things to do each day. The battles are 10/10. If I were to add anything though, I would make creating and getting more clan members easier somehow. After the removal of global chat it's been really difficult to build new clans",5
Let us enjoy the game even when upgrading! How can we train attacking and enjoy clan wars if we spend our time upgrading heroes!? Really? If we upgraded to next townhall e.g TH12 We need Twenty(20) upgrades of Grand Warden and Fifteen (15) Upgrades of Queen and King. For 7 days each how long we cannot enjoy the game and all we do is loot and upgrade? Let us use heroes while upgrading!,5
I thought it was an idle game but instead you just get constantly attacked by strangers and they steal all your stuff. I would check it once a day and all my stuff would be gone. I would get notifications all night from 11pm until 8am to tell me strangers were attacking me and there's no way to disable this,1
"Amezing game in the world, it can easily creat a intrest of any people on it. This game is like a chess game. We learnt new and new strategy in every attacks.😍😍😍, But it takes too much time in upgrading buildings and troops. 🥲🥲🥲",4
Nice very good intrestable no much more addiction than other game if you want upgrade buildings and take participate in clan war then you came to be only further then you don't be online for 24 hours and graphics is good when the game is open your mobile the sound is so classic type and strategy of evet such as good it's not a game is a mind game how to dependable fighting your base and how was it it's such a strong or not whenever enemy was attack can your base defense so hope you like comment,5
These days (after clan capital update) te game is crashing specially when we try to go to clan capital or sometimes just to open the game the screen becomes black this is not my phone's problem as I run other apps I don't face any problems there. I have been playing this game for years but i didn't have any problem like this before. I Hope this issue will be solved in future.,2
"For a least update yes this would really help us as coc players to save and conserve resources in training troops and spells and I'm hoping and looking forward for your next update will be the time reduction of upgrading of buildings, troops and heroes because it's very too long to wait b4 the time upgrade ends especially in th13 and th14. A little time reduction in upgrading will be much appreciated. So I hope as a coc player for many years my voice will be heard. Thank you!.",5
"My first strategy game and downloaded COC on last week of September, 2020. The beauty of this game lies in its simplicity and addictive combat strategy. The battle experience in the game is way better than other strategy games. Great job. In P2P battles in builder why the game waits to declare winner when one of the opponents have already achieved 100% destruction or when one of opponents have more stars than the other one whose game has already finished.",4
My favorite game class of clans. I'm proud of this game. It is very interested game. Everything interested in new season new collection. And every gold fast is amazing. But it is not give personally clash of clan items. 😓 I hope give me personally item. Thank you clash of clans community. Thank you this company. I am also happy for playing. All attack is amazing. And and wait for updating new season it is very interesting.,5
Nice game and it's stratzy to much I love I play game for 5 yr now I love this game and so much I play every time to maxed out my base but one problem is that do something about graphics hm..... I know what I am telling but yea graphics is main to Manage any game and do some work on graphics to do in 3d... Please all right all this is good now and reduce some time of building and helling time of hero it's take to much time to ready for the battle... All right all this my conclusion is it good,5
"Very wonderful game. It gets tougher as you go ahead 😂. Sometimes I have to search more than 50times before I can find a clan i can attack. But now I'm a boss😌. Although I think some work needs to be done with regards to the trips and their priorities when attacking. PEKKAs nearly gave me a heart attack the other day 😂😂. I love the new upgrades that have been implemented since i started playing this game, keep doing a good job.",4
"After I did the last update, I can't get onto the game. It keeps crashing on me now everytime I try to get on it. You need to fix this issue or I'm never playing again, and I've put in a lot of money and work for my village! Fix it and then maybe you'll receive more stars from me!",2
Clash of clans is a very good gaming app and I enjoy playing it but for updating resources or troops it takes more time and it takes more time to train troops and if we leave our game for a while or few day we lose our trophies and we also lose many things in the Game,4
The Game is outstanding . I am playing the game from a long time. But i have a problem that after the newely update the army troops are free of cost . Due to this the army troops have lost their Respect. By this They dont have that value which has been given by us for a long time. I Think that You should change that ( free cost army) .,4
It's a fun game to play and you don't have to pay any money for anything if you complain about 4 day upgrades then you yourself are impatient or lack patience try upgrading things for 10 days to 2 weeks it is fun game to regularly play I am a town hall 12 in this game it only takes awhile to get the feel for this game it is easy to pick up and play,5
This is very good and a quite addictive and i am playing it since 2019. But after the last update when i am trying to open the game it keep crashing. Firstly i thought it can be the fault of my mobile but then i realize that i am no the only person who is facing the problem.,3
"Hey Clash of Clan or super cell! After a long year i quit on this game, i finally played it again. But there's just a little bit problem. My frustrations of this game hunting me again. First, is the match making of the versus battle in the builder base and to the multiplayer battle. Second, the global chat is gone! Too lonely in the clan there's a few people you can talk and makes me feel boring while when theres global chat before i can talk to someone easily.",1
"Difficult to balance other life activities while ensuring that your base and your builders are always working optimally. I need to learn either not to care all the time (set a schedule?) or if it's too addicting I should probably quit. But it is interesting and fun to learn about the mechanics of the game and to develop bases and attack strategies. Addicting, but fun.",4
The Game is extremely Good. I have never faced a big problem as such in the game. The game requires a lot of patience and requires you to buy gold pass to progress through easily.,5
"Unlike clash royale, you only encounter troops you can use, rarely being one town hall away. Both builder base and home village are unique and fun. Unlike clash royale which for the most part relies on it's cards. It's both challenging and fun while clash royale is simply pay to win or play the game constantly for years. I will admit, clash of clans is a little pay to win but for the most part it is really nice and fun.",5
Garbage. If you like being a town hall 7 being attacked by a town hall 9 with max dragons then go ahead. You defense become pointless. I googled all the good base setups for different defenses. Constantly 3 starred by higher levels. Also allowing th 14 to share troops with lower levels is kind of ridiculous. I had one dragon take out my whole entire army when I was attacking. Pretty unfair advantage. I'm not gonna suck a high level players cock to get some OP troops. I'd rather win by skills,1
Fun overall game. Could be better with progress and keeping people entertained as the game gets into higher town Halls. Lose a lot of people in clan because gets boring as the game slows down. update times to long in higher town hall levels. gets boring compared to begginning of the game.,3
"Superb! I have been playing this game for years now and it keeps on improving. I just have suggestion if I may, when I saw the conversation at my Clan messages they said that it would be better to bring back the Global chat which I think is true however with a more stricter and improve security I guess. But overall, I have been happy and will continue play CoC ☺️❤️",5
I previously gave it 5 star but now it's 3. Why? Because my keyboard keeps dissappearing and then I can't talk with my clan mates and it's frustrating when we are busy with FCs and I can't cht with. I can only cht within 5 minutes of opening the game after that my keyboard won't come up. If this goes on longer I'm gonna be giving this game a 2 or even 1 star review just b'coz of that. Seriously what's the use of being in a clan if you can't talk to your clan mates. Hope u fix this issue.,3
"It is very intresting game and i really loved it !. But the rescent update there are so many bug found.. Sometimes game a crash for few sec.. It is very dispointing... So, my request is please fix the bug.. 🙏🙏",4
"It is good , I would have given 5 stars but, the time taken to upgrade buildings is very much upto 18 days which makes the game boring🥴🥴🥴😴😴😴 So I request super cell to decrease the building upgrading time and cost, After the 27 june update my game is crashing I am not able to open my game",1
Looks like a really fun game but haven't been able to play it at all gets s close to loading and then brings me straight back to the app store so unfortunately can't experience any part of the game apart from the loading screen,2
it's a really enjoyable game if you like to plan and strategize. in game purchases are incentivized and help you progress faster. but you can get to max level using free to play (though it takes guite awhile ) I've been playing for a month now and upgrades have slowed down a bit. playing multiple accounts has kept me busy though. was this reviews helpful?,5
Supercell is ruining the game at first it was adding the gold pass and now it's free troops I'm sorry but it's getting to a point where it's just stupid now the game is becoming more stupid. I started playing a few years back and that's when it was good before the night time base and etc. The game just doesn't feel the same.. 😭,2
"All of a sudden I can't attack, raid, etc. Game immediately restarts. Have tried restarting my phone, no luck. May be a problem with new Samsung update? Please take a look. Thank you.",4
"App is crashing like hell, hope they are testing it before releasing updates, app is getting stuck and exiting from launch, even after tried 100 times, hope it's already identified by the developers to fix it..",1
"I have been playing this game for almost 7yesrs. I love it. But I was updated MINER from level 4-level 5. It almost toke 10days, and finally it was going to complete it's update in 7hrs. And after few hours when I go back in the game, the MINER update is again updating from the day 10th. I don't know is this possible.",5
A good game from the golden age of games. Unlike most games Where if you dont play for like 2 months you basically get rekt in terms of gear. coc mainly focuses on teamwork and strategy. Because of the wide variety of troops and new existing content its not easy to get bored. I am f2p and i can say that its a good game that is fun and enjoyable with friends idk about going solo tho because you will not get alot of benefits. I wont say anymore because I have a war to win.,5
"Been playing since 2014 and left it multiple times, and also came back multiple times. The progress is also quite slow but still enjoyable. Edit: Free troops? Hell yeah! 4 stars.",4
"Actually this game is great. Already I have six accounts in this game. Very fun game to play in the free time. But I suggest not to play this game, 'cause this is very addictive. So you will waste your time playing this and neglect your daily works.... I'm saying this as I have all those types of experiences.",3
"After the recent update,coc is not working at all in my mobile.Its always buffering and showing no signal symbol , but I do have good internet connection.Please solve this problem.I used to play this game regularly,but now it's just getting irritate.I even lost connection during an attack in war.I hope you guys solve this issue.",1
"played for over 8 years, and in the update as of June 27, 2022 the update works except for accessing the BUILDER BASE. Once you access it, the game loxks the player there, and then drops the player from the game. i now can only START the game from GOOGLE PLAY, SEE THE BUILDER BASE FOR 2 SECONDS, BEFORE BEING DROPPED FROM THE GAME. COC DEV TEAM, PLEASE FIX THIS!!!",1
Supercell are you guys looking in comments to make game more enjoyable.I got one request please add an option to attack any member of our clan or our own base without challenge option. This way we can practice any strategy and therefore become more confident in ourselves (mostly during war). Make sure it becomes private. All of us dont want others to see our bad attacks😆😆.,5
"When are you going to address the other boring parts of the game like cost of walls, upgrade times and troop training times. 6 minutes for an e drag and 20 minutes for a siege is still to long when ya don't want to waste gems on troop donations. And would it be to much to ask to be able to change army combo during search instead of having to find a base that suits the army you've made",1
"I want to reset my data so that Im back at TH1. The reason that I want to reset my data because I wasted all of my gems. I tried going to settings and deleting all my data in my game it kinda worked but if connect to Google play a screen pop uped and said ""would you like to load ProCivil's TH4"" The current game will be lost"". My TH4 is saved I'm my Google play. I want my TH8 to be deleted. Only my data will be deleted and not my account. It would be better if you add a button to reset your data.",4
"One of the reasons why I find the game interesting is because it is hard to get enough resources and training troops were expensive. But now, with this new update that has removed the costs of the troops. I won't be surprised if one day I delete the game, its becoming too easy",3
"Great game, I have only been playing it for a few weeks and am already loving it. The only annoying thing is how long some of the upgrades take. But that's the only thing that I can think of that is annoying, great game keep up the good work guys and gal's.",5
"I love this game, but there is an glitch after the recent update, as my loading screen is becoming black and is unable to load, I would give a 5 star if this glitch is fixed, but overall it's a really fun good game.",4
Customer service is terrible and unresponsive. Game has glitches. Like now it says it's a new update but when selecting start the opening screen continuously runs.,1
Overall god but when you reach higher townhall level it takes alot of loot to upgrade anything even a single wall needs more than 1 million gold or elixer and about the time it takes alot of days to even build or upgrade anything like more than a week....hope you fix these problems soon 😗,4
"Can you atleast lessen the upgrade time, it's getting absurd that i always buy a gold pass, yet i still wait for like, 11 days for an upgrade to finish, and for the timer boost gem, i dont need 1 hour for it to last, i need it to really boost the training time of spell and troops, fast.",4
"Disappointed in you. For 1 yr and the concerns of old players like me who cant log in because we cant receive a code through email, its still not fixed and i think its ignored. So many old players wanted to play again but they suffer because of this problem. 1s because it ended up a boring game again and again with devs that not care for the concern of their players. Trash!",1
"Really good and fun only problem is that it is mostly fun when you just start playing again and once you do your daily things it gets a bit boring, especially if you don't at least have any gems to quickly finish your upgrades",5
"I know some people might not be happy with what I have to say, but I have more questions than awnsers. First of all why did you remove the natinal flag, I love seeing who likes what country and all that. It ia cool to see that one base with a different flag other than yours, and imo like to ahow off my flag. I have had the game near the start and love to see what new and amazing things you all have to offer, but I will miss the flags",2
"It's all good and all but what's with the 'you' joining leaving though? Nothing much to say it's just when you keep the clan open and trophy to zero this ""You"" kept joining and it's just annoying because the clan already is filled with messages left behind by the already mentioned subject. As much as i wanted to say is there any way to fix this? Or it will just keep happening unless i keep the clan to invite only?",4
"it's a very good game, it's addictive, you can't really blame it for downloading it, just in case sometimes when the signal weakens a bit, it suddenly backs up and repeats, but it's ok, it's fun to play",5
"This is the best game till now i love this game a lot , I am playing this game since 2015 ! Improvement:- In cwl we sometimes get very high level bases and we are unable to attack and we lose the war but if you can fix the matchmaking problem then I bet this game will be the best game !",4
"great game overall, creative and dynamic. The only thing that I didn't like as much is that the game has a slight pay to win vibe and it requires a lot of time and sweat in order to complete it. It could take years until you max everything out and before you even can there will always be more to upgrade so that is something that seems like too much. Also a good suggestion would be to make gems cheaper or easier to get. The gem mine was good but it's very little the amount is gives.",4
"I have been playing this game since a very long time, my mobile phones keep on changing with time, currently I am having this game installed on two devices but in one Motorola device ( Moto G5S plus ) this game crashes immediately or after sometime of starting but in another Motorola device( Moto One Power ) it's working fine. It's showing compatible with this device even I have played for years on Moto G5S plus but now what happened it's not working. Any Solution please suggest !!!",2
"It keep lagging when I load into the game.The entire screen was frozen,and I can't even move it.Then the game would crash after 10 seconds.Please improve it.(My device still has space to run the game,its not a storage problem.)",1
"really smooth and easy but, when searching for a battle it should automatically choose the ones with the most loot so you don't have to press the search button so many times. A new problem recently is that the textures aren't loading, so it just looks like a black mess. Over all a four star game, still, I do recommend.",4
"Its a very very very worst app. I am having so many problems running this app. It hangs, and it have connection problems also. It says to reload after sometimes. I am also having problem to go to my another id of clash of clan.",4
"Deleted the game because my 9-year account got hacked for some reasons that I don't know. FYI, it was connected with my Supercell ID and still the hacker managed to steal my account. I also tried to retrieve it which is successful but when I came back the day after, I cannot open my account again. I checked the profile of my account using my alt and found out that the name was changed and the clan its in is not familiar to me. I hope you can help me retrieve and secure my account.",2
"Great game, I'm had lots of fun and I'm currently Town Hall level 8. The game is easy to progress, challenging and all the building prices are good. What I would suggest though is that when you are attacking and you lose connection, it doesn't forfeit the match and instead ends it with no loss of trophies.",4
"I remember playing this game in old days. but the most fun feature is global chat, where people all around the world can sharing and get interacted with other player as well too, please developer, give it back that feature. I will buy that feature even if I have to pay to unlock it. thanks!",5
"Yo my game will not let me login anymore like I click on the game and it just brings me to a black screen, I do not know if this is happening to anyone else but can someone help me out. I love this game but what good is having it taking up space if it won't even let me in.",3
"Fun game I just hate how expensive stuff is =,) but then again it is worth a shot the games hella fun and I play with my intimate partner a lot after they introduced me to the game and ever since I always get on every single day to build and upgrade my base also a good way to kill some time if you want",4
Why do you people add the most useless features. This arcade thing is horrible the controls on them are very very bad especially on the race it lags a lot too. Instead of those you should add better chat interface when you're typing it's still as bad as it was 5 years ago. Also add feature that allows clan leader to set clan wars in and clan war out status on clan members i dont want to have to manually pick people for clan wars every time and don't want to kick people either.,4
Very good game! I find it has a sorta feel that makes you feel like an empire and that you conquer new kingdoms for loot as you search for whatever the heck you want. It uses strategies that would be useful for taking down kingdoms.,5
"I have a lot of fun, for many years, COC never failed to amuse me or keep me on playing, though I've get busy before and cant play at all and I just came back. I love the events and everything you do. I just hope there will be a 6th or 7th builder hahaha. Thank you so much for your hardwork Supercell ♥",5
"I have been playing for long and have never been really disappointed with this game. However, as other ratings state, there are connection problems, which one happened to be during clan wars for me. I had 2 stars and 96% and the connection got lost. When I rejoined, I had no second attack or any stars and we lost the war with a 2-star difference. I believe you should improve the progress of raids after a connection cutoff, like keeping on processing the attack with all the deployed forces",5
Gameplay is very good and updates are also quick but the match making needs to be changed most of the times it is match making with a higher townhall or builder hall in townhall we can skip it but in builder hall we can't do that and sometimes it crashes in middel of war.,4
Poor update heavy game hangs even my phone with 4gb ram There is lot of things to play but not meaning full except main base progress not wisely interconnected after 2 base and that floating town update makes progress more complex to play i have been playing since 2014 as long term membe i expect reply at least for my request if possible make things more interconnect that makes meaningful to progress one base....,2
It's a fun game and other than upgrading times I can't think of anything to complain about. But I have a suggestion. It would be cool to have clan wars in the builder base and also a new hero in the builder base and maybe a siege machine plz,5
"Everything about the game works, I just have 1 big problem. Dont play this game on wifi, only use mobile data. Ive found if my wifi dips for even a second, the game says connection lost. This usually happens during raids, which is frustrating as it costs troups and trophies. I have tried this on multiple wifi networks. Wish it would get fixed, a game should be able to run for more than a second if the wifi dips a little bit.",4
The game is overall good. But when I open the game and loading was complete screen was black and game was automatically closed. When I click the war button or clan capital the screen was black and game was automatically closed. Please this bug,4
I love this game. I have 3 profiles. Unfortunately after the new update my tablet has a virus and even after factory reset its still down. Gonna miss my elixir and gold ruin that's in my monthly gold pass challenges. My other profile on my laptop started crashing so I uninstalled my emulator and reinstalled it now I can't even get COC to upload. Im the clan leader and can't even log in. Clan wars about to start and Im screwed. Please fix.,3
"Yuhhhh Fool Call me a hidden telsa and you is a goblin ;) Nah but it's icey max and Whether dropping trophies for farming or gaining trophies for flexing, the game is still fun and playable. Upgrading times are fun, and I always love waiting to get the builder up and hitting them hammersagain. One thing I despise is how buying/selling anything is such a damn rip. I kinda switch between CoC and Cr every year. Because one gets boring. Love all supercell games as I am a huge mobile gamer.",5
absolutely incompetent. the game tried to update itself and then got stuck in a loop saying it had been installed incorrectly and needed to be reinstalled. I did that and my progress is gone. good job guys! avoid this game and all others by this company.,1
"It's too hard to edit my layout I think there is a bug,my screen can't move and I can't control my buildings try, to enhance the edit layout for smooth playing thank you,the new update is good I enjoy it",3
It's amazing no problems at all except when you got to the second island you only get to fight a few battles and then you have to wait 24 HOURS!! but other than that it's my favorite game I ever played,5
"I've had this app starting 10 years ago and I lost my account with my phone without my password in my gmail account so basically I lost everything in hte game. I'm one of the pioneers of this game and now , 9 years later, I'm playing it again❤️ I love all the upgrades and changes. Love it soo much!",5
"One of the best strategy game i played and still playing on,simple yet complicated as you progress, easy to connect less hasle, you can go easy or fast its up to you with or w/out spending.....",4
This game is very amazing game i liked tooo much I like to attack in clan capital too much I play this game all days and i attack in home village 4 or 5 time after few days the update was came I was excited for update when update came then I open game then 1. it was taking time to load 2. it is happening black screen when I open game 3. the game will crash 4. When also I open the clan capital it will crash or black screen. Please fix this issues then I can continue my id I played till 3 years.,3
"What can I say clash of clans has me hooked again, been playing this game for years and I always come back.. I would just for the love of God love it and I mean LOVE IT IF YOU GOT RID OF BUILDER BASE LOOT LIMIT:( I WILL UPDATE TO 5 STARS WHEN THIS HAPPENS. Sincerely a long time player of clash. I would also like to thank you for no adds because I'm sure you'd make a ton of money but you don't so thank you",4
"It's an amazing game, get your friends and make a clan together, attack together and more. The upgrade times mean that you're not always playing the game 24/7 making the game extremely fun when you do play.",5
"Great Update. So glad you guys went through with a Mega Base idea and it was incorporated really well. Everyone gets a chance to participate and you even buffed the Trader while you were at it. Love how a newer, more detailed art style was used with the buildings since why not take the chance to, and the music fits the theme really well. Only issues are just minor bugs, like the Home Village becoming blurry after visiting the Clan Capital. Still, great update to start the year. I'm so hungry...",5
"Great experience before, but now I have a major Pproblem that seemingly came out of the blue; crashing. When I first downloaded this app for the first few months it ran smoothly, but now out of nowhere I'm starting to crash a lot. So much the game has became unplayable and I've tried to find solutions. I re-downloaded the app which temporarily fixed it but a few minutes later I got the same problem again.",3
May I suggest a new feature? What if it were possible to queue building projects. So you can tell the builder what to start on next as opposed to having to time when you start a build so that you'll be online when it finishes. Allowing you to improve your base at a more optimal pace.,5
I like the update. But I like it more if there's tips n tricks or strat to use each heroes more effective and efficient. Or maybe add more attacking strat or base deff build tips. It more help for amateur,4
"it has a great graphics and calligraphy and was great to kill time if you dont have anything to do in home. especially during this quarantine. Hello supercell we happen to encounter a bug in the war where we cant attack the certain player saying that ""You can't attack this player tru again later"" ehat was that?? I'm trying to attack it for almost 2 hours now and yet I cant attack the base. There are 2 player in 30 vs 30. Thanks for fixing the bug but we didn't attain full star because ofthe bug",5
"I've played for awhile and I can say I like the builder base and the clan capital, but I would like to suggest maybe adding a new base. I think maybe an underground base would be cool. I love this game overall and recommend it for people to at least try it.",5
"Here's a new idea: Only people participating in Clan wars can donate troops to each other, no outside help. It defeats the purpose of the entire mode if the enemy clan has Town hall 14s, which aren't in the clan war, giving their town hall 11s siege machines, which town hall 11s don't have access to naturally. This should be removed immediately as it costed me a war that should have been a victory.",1
the customer care is terrible. i lost my clan due to inactivity. idek why there's a feature like this. yall dont just strip off a whole leadership from someone for being inactive. funny thing is im not even getting it back even with being active. i tried mailing but no response. terrible terrible customer service. hate it. what do i do now with the clan that you stole from me and gave it to a random person who's not active either?,1
"I enjoy the game and have played for many years, but here recently about a month ago for some reason my clan mates can not see my troop request and I haven't been able to fix it I've tried logging out of supercell and reinstalling.",3
"I would genuinely love this game as much as I used to if it wasn't for the damn night witch spam, like I cannot play a single freaking match in the builder base without losing 10 or 15 times in a row to somebody spamming the living hell out of the night witch it's annoying and repetitive",2
We can evolve et grow up all the time without end. The problem from the TH it's that improvements are very long and expensive. But I love this game since I'm 6 !,5
"No in game help centre that actually works , no one responds to you for help, you cannot report any suspicious player except only for verbal abuse , players who attack you will always have shield or guard or be unable to attack try again later will save them but nothing or no one will save you . Waste of tike game and its dying slowly.",1
Like the game. Played it a while back and decided to try playing it again. Would be 5 stars if it didn't take so long to level up the town hall and didn't have to pay to level up either.,4
"Love playing the game and has had some great updates recently, but with these it has brought in many bugs which cause your game to crash multiple times in a row before being playable.",4
It's really fun to play the game. The updates are also good. But It would be great if the army upgrade time is reduced since training army doesn't cost much resources,4
With the New update the game keeps crashing on my Android phone. I've been with playing for along time now and didn't have this problem before the update. I guess I have stopped playing until this gets fixed somehow,2
"It's a good game,it just takes too much time to upgrade the buildings and too much resources to upgrade the troops.I am a town hall 4 so I do not know about other upgrades for higher levels",4
"The over all update of the game was good. Its just that the donation before seem to be better than now. Me and my fellow classmates work so hard to level up the clan to achieve especially the plus level donation but the update seem to counter it's essence. With all your respect, I recommend that it would be better to bring back the older donation rule and also players like me would be so happy if global chat will be back again. Thank you!",4
I really enjoy this game and it would be a 4/5 if not for one issue. I have a WiFi extender that I connect to to get better WiFi but when I connect to it I cannot play Clash of Clans (or clash royal) please fix this or help me find what I can change,2
"This might be the best game than other games you expect, well sure it might take like days, or even months but it's worth the cost. Either you choose to take the time upgrading every day or the easier way buy ""Gems"" to make it easier you can build a whole defensive not only that but you can destroy other village, and loot coins. I recommend you should try it either pay to win kind of person or take it slowly kind of person.",5
I absolutely love this game. I have been playing this game for like 8 or 9 years and it still hasn't gotten boring. I would like supercell to create an option to where you can attack your own base to practice difference base layout attack strategies that are not in the practice panel. The game is still good regardless but it would still be interesting to have this option.,5
There are 2 parts to this game. 1 is bulding your base abd making it stronger. 2 is attacking other player to get materials. So when the game doesnt really let you do that there is no game. And the game really doesnt want you to that for a good while,2
I dont like the new update. When I open the app itself it takes longer when logging in even though I have strong connection. I hope you make the loading faster like the old one.,1
"It's good , I'm playing from 2017,But we need access to Heros for Friendly Challenge wether it's upgrading or not coz this will help us in practicing new strategies,and I wanna know if game makes some changes in our CC usage,if we can use seprate CC troops as per the requirements or for funnelling or else. This will be Good for everyone🙂🙂",4
"Casual and deep strategic elements. Clash of clans can be slow due to building timers and resource gathering, but that leaves time to build your base and stategize on new attack plans.",5
This game is super perfect for me cause I love editing and base defence and trophy pushing but I want a update that you can control your troops and if you just press the barbarian in you raid the barbarian that you press you can control it know like that and in every new year give all players a 100 gems every new year to make players enjoy more the game and I wish that you add like a villagers vision that you can control your game like you can go inside townhall and jump over the wall that's it,5
"Hey supercell I love your game but the only problem I see here is zero training cost, because if there is no training cost then the game might be less challenging and gamers may start to lose interest on the game, I hope you understand my point. Thank you.😊",4
Great game but it would be great if you could add a mode where you could attack your own home base with your chosen troops like you could use different attack strategies and try them on your home base so kinda like a training mode,5
Brilliant game to play. Requires time and patience to build your perfect village. I rate it 10/10. Highly recommended. No need to spend silly money on speeding up progress. I only purchased the extra builder and I buy the gold pass every couple of months just to get the discount on upgrades. Best advise I can give you is to compete in every clan games and every clan war league to get rewards.Thank you clash of clans,5
"Additionally to the gorgeous graphics and faultless gameplay, this game's whole concept is fantastic. The fact that the game's creators are paying attention to the user community is one feature I particularly like. That explains why the game is so well-balanced and constructed.",5
Nice game strategy sometimes annoying because when our village attacked you lost so many tropies of you're already in a high league and also in builder base the crusher is annoying it needs to be nerfed and the price of the upgrade building is expensive i think the daily bonus must be same as the main base because imagine wasting 1000.000 just for 1 defense And you need weeks to upgrade the other pls do any buffs to the builder base.,3
"Boring, after the recent update, I find it boring now. You no longer need elixer to train troops or what not. Where is the essence of competition there anymore. STUPIDCELL wanted to attract new players that they ignored the old ones, those people who are played this game from the very beginning. Fluff you Stupidcell.",1
This game is awesome and I like this strategy game but you need to lower building upgrade time and you need to add more country flags like Pakistani and you can improve its graphics however graphics are good and you can also upgrade builder base loot because it is too low,3
"The game keeps crashing all the time whenever I open it, I've reinstalled it, I've restarted my device, I've done everything it just won't open but other then that it's a really fun and good game",3
Theres something about this game I can't put my finger on it but how it's going on and the level of development being so good I think the biggest challenge for clash is gonna be to sustain this level of quality it has potential to be even better but in time the biggest competition clash will have is it self and competition with urself is gonna be hard...in ten more years ull understand what I mean...good luck clash,5
"I'd really enjoyed it, I still too. This game never gets boring. There are Plenty of things to do, from upgrading buildings, to attacking other players town. And this game is suitable for any age in my opinion.",4
Please change the shop. It is too easy to fatfinger a part of your screen and accidentally perform an in-game transaction. Make it such that the shop is divided into categories in which you have to click into before the offers are accessible and clickable.,3
Its a really fun game but there's just one issue. Everytime im attacking someone i lose connection causing me to lose at the game. The wifi im using is very strong but it keeps on losing connection. Pls fix this bug bruv,3
"enjoy this game a lot, came here because it couldn't stop bagging me to leave a review, also when you have stopped playing the game and come back after some time I don't need the village lady popping up and reminding me how to play the game. its really annoying",4
"Really like it you can build your village and upgrade, you can attack the others clan with your troops before you attack you need to train them by the way its nice and great app and thats all what i experience in this game theres no problem thats all the reason why i rated it 5 stars and if you have interest in this game why not download it, Good job👍.",5
The clan capital update was very cool buy I think they should have optimized it more because it started to glitches out after and now It crashes everything I open the game. I'm willing to put my review back to 4 stars it just sucks I can't play optimally on my older phone.,2
"I have been playing this game for almost 5 years now.. and it is still beyond my expectations, the updates and new things just make it a whole new thing to do. I just want a green online sign on the players who are online in the clan. It would make it easier for clan leaders to know which player is online..",5
"Poor design, if your gonna limit the amount of trophies you get when you win, then stop taking away full amount when your super close to winning, like, if you challenge a base and you get 49%, you shouldn't lose the same amount of trophies as if you did 1%,",1
"Really simple and easy to do game, only downside is that progression gets a ton slower the more you progress but it also unlocks more abilities to learn about the game.",5
When I played single player i won and then it didn't load when it showed 3 three star victory i reload the game since it wasn't loading it took my troops but didn't give me the win when it clearly said i won 2! Flippen times wth supercell either make it so we all get refunded of our troop when that happen or i will quick playing your games From me,1
"In the beginning its really boring ad you don't have to worry about attacks because of your shield.But later on it gets funner, especially joining clans and participating in clan wars.Something I didn't like was that the upgrades took really long, but other than that the game is pretty fun.",3
"I recently had a bad experience where I accidentally clicked on a pirate flag in the store and was charged 500 gems. I had difficulty contacting Supercell to ask for the transaction to be cancelled and my gems refunded. A rep finally responded to tell me they won't give me a refund. They claimed that I had confirmed the purchase after clicking on the item, but that isn't true. If the flag was 50 gems I wouldn't have bothered to ask for a refund, but 500 gems is extreme.",2
"I have been playing this game for 2 years. I have never felt bore rather it give more fun. You can easily progress your base and push trophies, clan games , clan war league and more much events gives fun and addiction to play this game.",5
"Clash of clans is a very good game with no glitches from what I see. There is a large variety of buildings and cards, and these can all be upgraded multiple times.",5
"This game has an amazing strategical feel when you are playing it, and it is one of those games that you don't have to pay to win. You can level up your town hall and other buildings without paying a cent because of being able to collect resources and raid other players resources.",5
I have been playing this game since frm 2013 it's a great strategy game but the thing is it take a lot of time to train our troop even when we boost the potion it shud be take zero sec.. please fix this issue thank you other wise its a great strategy game..!!!,5
Another update and more trouble with loading game. I don't know if this is a glitch or the servers are being overloaded. My WI-FI connection is solid. Once again please fix.,1
"really a good game.it doesn't trigger you to splurge more on buy things, easy to play in storage wise it doesn't coat an arm and leg, don't need to spend so much of time but you can spent get by time you have, don't think too much just install it and enjoy it.",3
"Good game,we and my friends playing it a lot of time's, new scenery, free skin, event is on going and i suggest that maybe add war on builder base to come up a new challenges for the players.",5
"Great Game, good for playing with friends, no ads, only in app purchases to progress faster, unique gameplay, great updates and overall a solid game. 10/10 would recommend.",5
"what is wrong with this game, it doesn't even load and every time I try to open the game, a black screen appears and the app automatically quits itself. please fix this problem. I have been playing this game since 2015😞",1
No way of receiving help. noone to message or contact directly. I'm a co leader in a clan tried to find war for almost a week now it searches for 24 hrs then we get told there no clans to battle against this has happened 4 times in the last week. I've posted on FB asking for help on twitter sent messages and 0 assistance. They have no issue taking money to buy gems or other items but have 0 customer support!!,1
"Great game, very relaxed and enjoyable to play but one thing that really iratates me is the cooldown fot a base before you can challenge. (context) the challenge button is in the clan chat and its where u can let ur clanmates attack ur base wih no loss, just for fun. But if you edit your base you arent allowed to challenge that base for 24 hours which is a waste of time and we want to test that base but cant for 24hours. its just dumb, thats the only issue i have with the game.",5
It's really a very nice game. I am playing it from many time but I never felt that it's a vary boring game. I really like this game. But I think that there must be a option to buy some sceneries and hero skins with gold or elixir,4
Hey guys its been pleasure playing COC more than 5 years. It's been a very interesting game but now with introduction of other games it is becoming less popular. Most of the clans are inactive. We are unable to recruit new active members. Earlier we used global chat to invite players it was an easy process. Now with the withdrawal of that feature COC is becoming boring. Hope you understand. Please bring back global chat feature.,3
epic game. though i wish upgrading st the higher levels took much less time. I get that it should be a challenge to upgrade at high th levels but to wait over a week for something to finish is a bit absurd,5
"Tbh, 4.6. I am probably biased, but I played this for 10 years, no gameplay issues, so can't relate to ppl with crash problems. I can't agree with complains (especially regarding P2W), upgrade time and rss needed as ppl should appreciate having potions, books, hammers and updates to reduce upgrade time N costs. I can reach th8/9 in a month+ now. Only downsides I agree are a non-existent customer service N builder base though its impact was massive for super troop N clan capital - the real coc :)",5
"I absolutely love the game. You can make a village/base. Make armies to raid other bases and gain loot. Join clans and participate in clans war. Get new troops, heros and more. There's so much you can do in the game. I highly recommend playing it.",5
"This is my 3rd account lost two that had reached dragons and recieved zero customer support go to google, no go to supercell. I have finally reached past that point again. Now almost every match i am in during the wars and etc. I am being placed against players many lvls ahead of me on a near constant basis. It is making me look bad in my clans eyes and i am tired of it just stop it. I do not care if they do not place all building etc. Stop placing me at constant dissadvantages. Force them up.",1
"There's nothing much i can say except for ""I love this game so much"". I'd always wanted to download this game ever since I had experienced playing this once, but too bad my old phone didn't have enough storage but now I can finally play the game and enjoy as much as I want.",5
"Please delete COC, poor support. I have invested too much time and effort for almost 8 years leading my village to be locked for multiple login because I changed phone and access the village on the new phone. Support can't help or accept my identity verification, if I the owner itself cannot unlock the village then who else. Stupid COC support logic, I have the access on the Supercell ID and Gmail where I linked the account. Just send the unlock code to the registered e-mail. Stupid.",1
"It's okay but very addictive, this game don't have anything interesting in particular but will waste most of your time in this. And upgrade time are way too high like every single thing take 14 day to upgrade",3
This game is cool I like this game there is many army for attack and upgrades village and other thing but I think there is one problem that is it take much time to complete upgrades thing so please reduce the upgrades time please please please.,5
"This game is totally awesome and thanks for elixir Updated it make our game more amazing 🤠 And some issues I found now my game is crashing every time when I open my game 😅 When I open my game it itself back or black screen appears .I have 3 GB ram mobile .may be my phone problem But only this game crash and auto back When I open this game plzz fix this I want to play clane game and also take my reward from clain game , raid clane capital is also begin. Thank you supercell .",4
"When I start a clan war with my 4 th8 and 1 th 7 that is 5v5, sometimes my opponent has(th 9 one or two), and now there's a th 10. How am I gonna win if I can't even out match or matches there bases and troop capacity.. fix this matching in clan war. But overall the game is good..",4
"My favorite game, play it daily. Made good friends all over the world who have joined my clan. Only problem is limits to game play in the top league. You don't even need to spend real money in the game if you don't want to, you can slowly accumulate free gems to buy all you need.",3
Been playing this game for more than 8 years now.. update after update devs just put on ridicules things into the game.. This is not clash of clans any more. Only thing kept this COC on top of others kept removing one after another. Now troop training cost. Like really dude? That was the last thing kept the balance of the game and only thing player had to manage.. now just like that it is gone.. funny part is they remove troop training cost and keep the over priced wall upgrades!!. Just fix this,1
"Why did you guys remove the training cost?🤧🤧🤧 It disrupts the balance between spending elixir and spending gold, thus resulting in more accumulation of elixir than gold, and there wouldn't be any other way to spend the elixir once you have upgraded all your troops, barracks and gold mines. But gold has such huge demand as it has to be used to upgrade everything else. Please bring back the training cost😭😭😭",3
It's an alright game. I check it about twice a day. At low levels you can sink a bit of time in building stuff but as you start to level up any upgrade usually take a full 24hours or longer. It gets to the point where if you want to do anything in the game youre really urged to pay for progress. If you don't mind waiting massive amounts of time though then the games alright.,3
Amazing game definitely fun but this is gonna take some time so if your just about to start here's some tips don't skip the levels for your tower it will get you back so don't skip the levels most important rule I wish I had these tips when I was playing,5
"Super cell ,can you please make some changes,in choosing a set of trained army during attacking on multi player ? I can train a two set of army in home village, ground troops and air troops,but i can't choose the other set of army , in the multi player. First trained army is the only option when searching for loots, what im trying to say is that, when my first army is ground troops, and the village ive search is an anti ground army, i want to change my army by my second reserve , air troops.",4
"Deducted 1★ for lagging, expect it other things are good to play. But i have one request to clash of clan team, it will be more fun if the number of clan capital raid is increased to 10. Beacause in higher lvl it takes alot more time and raid to finish a full clan capital also sometimes players has to finish 97%-99% districts which is a big loss. So hope it will be solved and clan capital clash will be more fun.",4
"Customer service sucks. I have been trying to retrieve my old account. Gave them all the info I can remember and was banned for 31 days for trying to take someone else's account. If they actually listened and worked with me I would have already had my old account, but no. Now that account will just be sitting there forever due to inactivity cause I can't get any help. If I could get my old account back, I would change it to 5 stars immediately, but I doubt I see that ever happening.",1
"I like this game from the beginning of the release, started playing 2016 and I got many friends in this game from my own country and also other countries. Even made my own clan, until now it's been 6 years and little by little they started to stop playing this game so do i , I have wonderful memories from this game hopefully we can be together again in one clan and make wonderful memories again. See you guys again. #From your old clan leader..............",5
"Stale like a box of opened crackers, still edible but the longer the game goes on the worst the flavor. Sure adding some salt every now and then may help but at what point is the game still a cracker and not a pile of flavorless crumbs of what it was and salt.",3
"The game is good strategy the way handle everything but please bring back the world chat and reduce time upgrade that's the only problem of the game if you can fix it, fix it immediately or asap if you only can because the game is more fan when it has world chat and also its more fun if you reduce time upgrade thx",4
"The only bad thing in this game is that the upgrade time is too long the eagle is like 17 days that freaking too long iam a bit impatience so i cant wait that long Supercell should reduce the upgrade time to 1day or 2,3,4 days so we can have fun of having max base iam at town hall 14 for 9 months and only the collecters and walls are left to upgrade and one other thing is that the wall is too expensive they are hundred of them and its too much of a grind to max the wall so please reduce the cost",3
"after the last update, I can't open coc, it keeps on crashing, tried uninstalling and download again but it still crashes, I deleted some files to make space in the storage but it doesn't work also",4
"I've been playing this game since 2013-14 when I was a child and the max was th10. It's a great game, with its flaws like every single game to ever exist, but I never felt stuck when upgrading my village. For sure, it gets slow, reaaally slow, but that's something I really like since I don't truly enjoy a game where I need to dedicate my soul to. Time passes and you get better. That's it. And, at least for myself, the feeling I get of progress is amazing. sry for eng.",5
"They paused my village saying ""Villagers need a short break while been for long time with out a shield"" and that was right after I used building speed position which took me hours fighting in 10 years challenges to get it thanks plus the 2 m gold and 2m ex what a mess",1
"A good game for evar ,But from 2 july 2022 It has some Glitch or something went wrong. My clan preks are still full but it doesn't upgrade to the next level. I am looking for authorised action very quickly for this big problem . Thank you sir,",1
Game is cool but they have made so manying changes that they can't keep up with the problems used to be able to talk with support and they took that away probably because of all the problems with the game going downhall fast u can't have anything that takes your money and no one to talk about problems in all just really bad leadership in the game see ya supercell,1
"Best game ever. No ads. But I keep getting ""Your defense lost!"" And I can't upgrade my defenses because I need more gold then my gold storages can hold to upgrade the village. The upgrade time takes pretty long and the gems required to skip is more than I can afford! My elixir runs out too when I'm upgrading the gold storages so yeah. However, this doesn't bother me much because I know this game is supposed to be challenging and takes time. You should consider downloading it.",5
A very fun and interesting game. But I had to change my mind recently because of the server. I've recently attacked a base and 3 starred it and the game reloaded again and made me lose 35 trophies (my network connection was very good)... and this isn't the first time this happened to me. Can you plz fix this issue?... I lost many trophies because of this,4
Only ever had 1 terrible experience with supercell (trying to unlock my act). Had to wait till 2 am to contact customer support who took 45 min to reply per message. If your reading this and u have the same problem.... GOOD LUCK.👍 Other than that great game to waste ur time and money on.,3
The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is how long it takes for upgrades at higher levels. Upgrade times are excessive for no reason.,4
"It was great, but I have some suggestion😅. In the season challenge,I suggest that maybe at the last reward, you may put different book reward not just book of heroes for atleast to those people who can't afford to buy gold pass:)",5
"Simply a legendary game. I have played this game for almost 10 years, and now I'm back at it again... I just wish that a proper ""Global Chat"" will be available again, since we can play with so many people abroad, including create a clan with them (just like the old days).",5
"Cant log in to game, you are not even sending the verification code on my email! I tried to get some help from the chat support but they said i was trying to access the account that is not mine and banned me for 31 days. Before, logging back in was easy because i only have to log in to my google play, but thanks to your supercell id, i cant use my OWN account that you guys said wasn't mine. And now i have to start over again. Years of effort, gone.",1
"The game is one of the best nowadays but i am facing a lot of connection issues. It's very frustrating so kindly solve the problem, SUPERCEL.",4
"After update,graphics and sound is fully changed. Graphics becomes of low quality & every building that I tap it sound like tapping on wall & when I upgrade them it sounds like object removed but getting no gems. When bowler dies it sounds like barbarian is dead & same thing happens to healers sounds like archers, itz funny😂😂, but please fix these glitches. There are so many sound glitches I cant explain everything in this post so I request Supercell to fix these glitches as far as possible🥰",5
"Please bring back the global chat. Its borring when you dont already have a clan and its very hard to find clan, like if the clan does'nt want to accept low th players. And also, I hate it when my mobile data switches from 4G to H+. It just restarts all of a sudden. (Location: Philippines) But this app is greate, but for now I only give 4 stars. That's all thank you. Love this app btw.",4
"The game is wonderful and all but I think it would be better if we could challenge friends on our friends list that are not in our clan,like a one on one kind of stuff and maybe private chat as well.",3
I have been playing this game for at least a decade now and honestly as far as a mobile game goes this is the best I've found and the developers stay on top of it always adding something new and furthering your experience with the game so it never gets old and there is always something to do definitely a must download for any game fans,5
"Great game! Great graphics and features, makes it an awesome game! But the play barb home is super pathetic. It takes a second to move.",3
Actually game is good but the problem.is that i dont know why my account got banned and i am trying to connect supercell regarding my id but no on replying and also an not able to recover my account. I am facing problem opening my account its not opening. When i enter supercell code is again shows one more pop-up saying that you need to write a security code. If anyone knows tell me how to recover the id. Thank you,2
"Great game without the need for quick reflexes. Multiple styles and concepts especially good as a team game (clans), but you can't compete successfully without spending money ☹ Update 2022. Still playing, still paying (about $5 a month). I play every day for about 30 minutes to make sure I'm doing my part in the build of the clan. Supercell keeps improving the game, but I wish they would add to the builder's village.",5
"This game would be a lot more fun if they added queues for upgrades, added an option to report for griefing, and made the wait times more manageable. Another great addition would be allowing more than one builder to work on something :)",3
Game is fun however it takes way too long to upgrade buildings and characters. Upgrades shouldn't have to take a couple of days. Should be shorten,1
I do love coc and have many accounts before now i only have 3 main accounts... Why am i fgiving this 3 stars? My cellphones get hangs these past few months and i am getting really annoyed now because it gets lagged when i play so i don't have a choice to restart this app. It gets lag day by day and i am not liking this at all. Only have 2 game apps and have 7gb in cp and 13gb in memory card so why it is lag. I am confused why it gets lag always and when to open this app can someone fix that?,3
"My first impression with the idea of training troops without elixir cost is making the game less challenging. Supercell might focusing on the clan capital that's why they make this change, but it is proven that the main village is the real attraction for the game and others are just value addition.",3
Game is quite good playing it since 2015 but recently my account was locked for security purposes i tried contacting support but at last they denied unlocking account. Staff is rude and not ready to help and cooprate overall game is very good with frequent updates and all and will change review as soon my problem is solved Thank you!!,1
"Ive played C.O.C a very long time, and the one time i linked my account with ""supercell id"" I lost all my progress, now from town hall 13 im stuck at town hall 3 and I cant even fix it, now I requested data deletion , hopefully it only deletes the data off the supercell id and not google play games too. Thank you SUPERCELL, over 6 years down the drain.",1
"I used to regularly play this game before the recent update. After the recent update, as soon as I open the app, it just shows a black screen and crashes on its own. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app a number of times, but it still shows a black screen and crashes on its own. Please let me know how to fix this issue. (Will update rating post receiving any response and if the issue is sorted)",1
"Everything is great ! But the time to upgrade buildings and troops is very much high , so i request supercell to reduce the upgrade timings.",5
"Please add the move account or change the email of the supercell account, please add it, I hope it's done for my other account, I forgot it, so please put it here But I hope it lasts a long time and I hope it doesn't disappear because it's a very good game and the one in the clan, if someone takes a leave, there should be a cooldown when joining, that's all, thank you",5
"If you are looking for an advanced magical game with players around the world this is a game for you,, , it is very addictive, competitive, and developments are constant great time killer but the upgrades time and golds for it are really too much but nice game..but recent days this game has become a pay to play game",5
This is a good game but since that April update came out game gets crashed again again. At first i thought it was my Mobile problem and ignored it now many of my friends are also facing this problem. Now also before writing this review iam trying to open the game from 15 mins it starts and after that intro page it gets blank. Please super cell correct this problem,1
"""A great game"" only these words are there to express this game for me but the main motive to write a review is that in game there is a problem which i am facing too is that i cannot find new members for my clan as i click search button under the FIND NEW MEMBERS section there is not even a single result i hope SUPERCELL will take a look towards my problem thanks and this os the best game i have ever played . Thanks 🤗😊",5
"Doesnt launch on my Acer Chromebook, same as reported by a lot of people with Acer Chromebooks. Should be compatible, and the game runs on a lot of Chromebook models now. However, the new Chromebook that I have with some high end hardware it doesnt work on because Supercell wont bother getting it compatible with Acer models for some reason. Maybe Acer wouldnt pay a Supercell ""fee"" to allow it to work?",1
It's a good game it takes smarts and also takes a while to build your village big. And now I have a descent village but just saying that it takes time to build stuff because it takes time. I love this game it's dope.,5
"All the new kids complaining about the upgrading times and how the builders aren't enough and blah blah.been playing for almost 10 years and still think that it's amazing because if you can just be able to upgrade anything in like 10 hrs or so then what's the point of playing a game like CoC?You just play it for a month...max everything out and just quit?the essence of the game will be lost if they make it so easy so, new kids please jus stop whining and play it like real men did back in the day",5
"Hands down best mobile game ever, there are some minor annoying parts though such as when you are later on and have to wait 4 DAYS FOR A FRICKING POTION TO UPGRADE, maybe you could assign multiple builders to one building to speed things up, over all great game. Ps I would suggest making a clash of clans tower defense I think that would be a hit, another thing would be cool if you made a game like this but star wars instead. Overall love this game and you should definitely download it.",5
"Worst app ever. It would take a lot of time for upgrading the buildings. It might be better if they can shorten the time when it comes to upgrading the buildings and etc,. Even one star this game doesn't deserve.",1
Every thing is good. Pls make changes on friendly challenge 1. We can use our heroes while upgrading. 2.We can take any troops in our CC for attacking. Then it will be awesome for learning every startegy.😁😁,5
Great game. I took 2 stars off due to customer service. They banned my account for 30 days becuase they thought I was a hacker. But unfortunately I'm just a paying customer. Scares me that I could spend all this money and they could just close my account. Not cool.,3
"In coc game, you can put the earth inside buildings and water on the surface of the buildings (floating). It would be better if it is provided in the next update. My favorite game to play is coc. I like clash of clans",5
"It is a very good game. I love it. But we need justice. For example : if we attack a base 100% = 27 trophies and loose = 29 trophies, if we get 50% We get only 2 or 5 in that war thats fare. But if we loose at 49 % the trophies correctly minus -29 . But why ? You should decrease the minus trophies to 13 or 15 . Most of us are like this . Many get angry and uninstall the game . Everyone would like if you bring this feature in the next update . Even though the game has great graphics. Thank you 🙂",5
"Army training is free, it is a great decision. But one thing more I wanna mention, if u could add some more usages for Village elixir like defence upgrading. At the end and the most important and satisfying next update can be, being able to upgrade the walls with Dark Elixir, maybe at least for TH13 and higher. plz, we will wait for this. For dark elixir it's not only my idea, as I have mentiones this with a huge amount of my friend everyone was happy for this,,, Derian we wait for this 💕❤",5
Well the Super Cell Nazis have locked me out again. I made the mistake of not running all my payments thru Google Pay and can't give them the detailed proof of purchases they are looking for and are now accusing me of trying to steal my own acct. I have spent tons on this stupid game and now can't retrieve it. Good Luck to you if you lose your acct. aholes,5
"I want the latest version,, I update the new version,,I think it's bad,, I can not attack,,in time to battle disconnection,, then less your score,,less your army even the battle is not finish,must better the latest version,, I'm not enjoy",2
"It's a stupid and unfair game.. People attack you and you can't attack them because they get shielded why is there then a revenge button that don't seem to work All you get is a shield for probably 15 hours after it's done you get attacked again and over again.. The game is a money grab and statistic shows it all, as you go higher in THL upgrading takes hours and days to finish yes it's the developer idea to frustrate you to throw money on a worthless addicting game",1
Very interesting game. It's about my treasure..why I can't choose gold or elixir to collect with a special amount that I define it .... When I make collect my treasure I must collect all instead of that I only need some amount to all.. Can you review this and give us option to collect only some according what we need .. Urgent please 🥺🥺,5
All game is good but i can directly ask to the developers ... Why should you don't upgrade your playing level like you should also as you make a supercell id and also we should add friends in that option but we don't communicate privately in that type of service you should upgrade this section in which all the social media persons is spent much time in the clash of clans game... Use of this you should achieve your progress of activeness of the users.. Please read and do action as quickly,3
Amazing game the only problem I have with it is that about a week ago they got rid of all national flags. The game gave no coin refund to the players for one thing. Otherwise 5 star game but I WANT MY AMERICAN FLAG BACK!!!,4
Since this june update i cannot open my account. I try to contact supercell but they dont response. Its been more than 7 years playing this and always buying gold pass monthy to reach max level. Supercell dont care about the player. I am really disappointed with this update.,1
"Loving the new update. And I have a suggestion, in starting a war maybe you could add a feature that can automatically start a war where the time and date can be set by leaders and maybe Co-Leaders too. This feature can be really helpful for me because I usually forget to start wars.",5
"Playing this game for 8+ years, the only reason why continued to play for so long is that it used to take no loading time, it had the convenience to have quick check and close; but now it is taking so long open, fix it as soon as possible or I will uninstall it forever",1
After years of playing it's a must have for me. I'm free to play player and enjoy it so much I'm th13 and the potions and everything is Amazing in the grind for th14. I'm one of the lucky ones when builders costed 500gems each excluding the master builder. Overall nothing bad from my side absolutely love this game!,5
"The Game is great. However, one weird just happened... As I was trying to join a clan, my wifi disconnected. So when reconnected, it showed me that I am not in a clan. However, when I tried to join a clan, it said that ""Player is already in a clan"". I have no idea how this happened. Pls advise me how to fix this problem since I am unable to join any clan.",4
"You gather the required resources, click on a building to update it, and then you still have to wait hours or days or months as it updates. Everything takes time, which is the most expensive commodity, and it's not time you can spend actively doing quests or challenges in order to advance, it's time just waiting for things to finish happening.",3
Great game.... I'd love to see a ladder on the new clan raids... just to know how well others are doing ... also I'd like to see a way to stop people joining doing their raids and leaving to get more raid points from higher clans .. also I'd like to be able to test attack my own base .. I think it would be helpful building defences.. no complaints on upgrade times or costs .. p.s builderbase sux,5
"Best game ever,started playing 4 days ago and it is highly addictive 😍😍 but there there is one issue, you need too much resources to upgrade the defence system. Over all the gaming experience is very nice👌👌👌",4
It was good until I tried to get back on for some reason it pulled me aside and made me get onto my account and nothing I just kept getting crashes and when I would log on it'll keep doing the same thing it has a bug need to fix I played it for years and now it was hard for me to get back on please fix it's a good game best just like clash royale.,5
I've been playing this game since I was a kid. It's a huge grind and alot of it is upgrading your buildings. It's can take up to like 10 days to upgrade a building in the higher levels but it's still super fun to watch your village grow. I also love the cute animations that they make for the game. It's definitely a game that's up there with minecraft for me.,5
Played this game daily until the most recent update. Now the game freezes and crashes as soon as it loads. Now there seems to be another update but I am unable to get the update to actually update. Not sure what the problem is but it's very disappointing,3
"Some one is playing my account ..... But I can't stop it .... I tried over 10 times to disconnect supercell id but it didn't work..... But I am sure that after disconnecting from Supercell ID no one else can played my account .....every one's same problem was fixt but my same problem are not fixt ...... I requested the community Centre to fixed my problem ..... ""Please""",1
Wish we could buy gold pass from the gems🙂 The game is all good but it has one drawback that the selling cost of the potion through gems is very less as compared to the buying cost of the potion. It has to be done equal so that the player could sell there extra potion for the same amount of gems as they are buying it.,4
The game is a nice strategic game. It's very good from the troops to the development of the base. But one more thing the time to develop your base is toooooooo long,5
"I would say this is one of my favorite mobile games and for a good reason, there are no ads. I never liked games with ads everytime your doing something and then you have to pay for a premium subscription just to get rid of them, this game has no ads, but comes with a weird glitch. The game sometimes can be really laggy and crash on you. This has happened to me a lot, my internet is perfectly fine and my phone is still good to use for another year. Hopefully this problem gets fixed soon.",3
"Coc i really wanna know what is this.. if a th13 player attack on th9 player in master league then th9 player lost 30+ trophies everytime but if th9 player attack on th11,12 even on 13 then what we won just some trophies like 15-16 thats it..... Why this is happening every single time.... We also want to go to legend league.... Why we wait if we have the capacity to win and go to legend league.... All tho the game is super good I'm playing this from almost a year but please fix this issue.",1
"iam at townhall 7 but my village attached by townhall 8and9 ,they takes my trophies upto 47,39 (above 30) but when I going to attacking they shows mostly townhall 9 iam unable to attack th9 ,rarely sometimes showing th7, th6 with very low trophies like 2,1,3,4, This really irritates me ""so Make sure this doesn't happen again"". and manage my english also.",1
"5 star game. My only concern (and it's not much) is the new update. Paying elixir for troops and waiting for a long time for certain ones used to be a huge part of the game, and they removed it without any warning. However, it gives people the opportunity to find a good attack strategy without worrying about wasting time and resources. I believe they should return prices at a reduced amount on the next major update, and keep the new training times. Golem used to take 10 minutes! (I think)",4
"Builder base is hella a pathetic mismatching section, I have Builder base 3 and during versus battle my opponent has a Builder Base 4 or 5. Level 4 BB has extra archer tower, mega bomb, walls, air bomb, army post & army camp. How would my small army of BB 3 suppose to defeat this all? Half of my army always gets distracted by those army post troops . How am I suppose to win and gain loot and upgrade my BB. Fix this mismatchig issue I have already lost so many versus battles because of this.",1
"Been playing this game for nearly a decade now, since it's humble beginnings. It's the one game I've always played throughout the years, and have always consistently had fun on. Thank you Clash of Clans, for a wonderful gaming experience!",5
"31st August 2022... Latest update has broken the game. Won't start at all. Even tried reinstalling. Google Pixel 6 Pro running Android 13 and trying the latest app version. 8th September 2022... Same issue. Try loading game, screen goes black and game force quits!",1
"The rating system is quite, bad to say the least. In both villages i progress through the rating faster than i progress in terms of upgrades. So im forced to fight enemies that are way stronger than me, everytime i lose the rating will go down and that will make things balanced... for a few fights. After that it repeats.",3
I stop playing for 2 years and my phone was lost but luckily I still retrieved my accounts. Thanks to supercell ID. It was great because it continuing updates I was amaze when I saw the new heroes skin and TH. Great good job developer.,5
"I am Hadi Ansari a student currently studying. After 22th June update clash of clans is consuming too much my 'Internet' the game is good, but unfortunately I have no more data left I am not able to play it anymore. Because I have limited data after using 2GB my speed got reduced Thanks you! If you try to solve it😊",2
"Amazing, I love clash of clans. The characters and the graphics are the best. Lots of availability for progression and I recommend. Would be cool if you could upgrade builders huts, speed up upgrades? Would love to work for supercell one day, would be awesome. Thanks for the game :)",5
"I like the game very much. But I am having an issue since the last update. My ground troops like wizards and pekkas are not visible neither when deployed nor when in army camps or on archer towers. Pleass fix this bug as soon as possible, I hope youll do",2
"The new feature that makes home village training free has ruined the game, it is now too easy, you used to have to decide whether a base was worth attacking based on if you would gain more loot than you spent on your troops",1
"I love this game, and I grew up with it through my early childhood. After this update however, it started to crash a lot. It never did before hand but now it just crashes within 20 seconds of playtime. Maybe they could fix thus but other than that, I love the game but cherished the classic Clash of Clans.",4
It is AMAZING it has everything lots of tropical and upgrading BUT at the beginning of the game they should give more 💎 and some of the training troops take loots of time but after all its really fun 😀,5
"Very fun strategy game to play, although I don't like the fact that it is very hard to get gems, it would be cool to get gems when doing online multiplayer battles, something like a gem holder or something. That would be cool.",5
"Frustrating to learn and grow your attack strategies, but a fun game nonetheless. Except for the Builder Base. One of the worst ideas to come out from this team.",3
I only give 3 star's because there is no logic in troop training. The training time of elixer and dark elixer troops should be seperated because they have different barracks. But they are put together which takes a lot time to train troops. Except that i love the the game. Thank you.,3
A nice game which have been improving in every update. I've played it since 2017 and it's been a fun game for me. It is hard at beginning if you don't have knowledge about things but you will figure it out after You've played it. A fun and nice game at my opinion.,5
"These days as soon as I open the game like in 30 second, it disconnects and unable to play. Because of this unable to attack , start a attack and donno when it's disconnected. Just not able to play the game",1
"I had two words spelled out in my home base (You're dead), a humorous message to those raiding it for loot. In a game whose paradigm is to destroy bases of your opponents. It was deemed ""offensive"" and scrambled by Supercell. Along with my builder base which was not offensive in any way. Supercell refused to restore either base. UNFAIR!!",1
It's a very good game. It is so much awesome that it can help you recover from girlfriend loss. Also I have been a Bgmi player since a long time but I still say this game gives a tough competition to any other mobile game. It is so much soothing. Lots of love ☺️ for the developers...!!!,5
Redownloaded it after 6 years and it has been both fun and dissapointing because of the upgrade timers. It's boring to log in to your account and do nothing because all of the builders are busy for DAYS.,2
"It's a great game but my only problem is excess dark elixir my heroes are maxed level for town all 14 but my defenses are almost maxed,but that's my only problem excess dark elixir honestly they should reverse the latest updates Remove the timer when training troops and add the cost back so it's more challenging because I also have excess elixir that I have nothing to do with(other than the lab which takes days or even weeks on th 14) over all it's a great game 5 starts for suppercell😊😁😅🤩👍",5
"I love the game, been playing forever, but after this latest update it crashes after launching. It's a 5 star game, but it just has that one problem right now so I can't play. Just hope it gets fixed!",1
"Fun game but ever since you guys (Supercell) Tended to ""fix bugs"" caused another one where My device isn't connecting to your servers on here an making me lose War attacks an affecting my in game play with Clans! If you could fix another bug that you caused would be GREATLY APPRECIATED",1
"Why I cannot play the game after the update, it was just loading the game but once your in the game the apps will shutdown for about a seconds...I have 4 accounts registered in supercell, please help us to restore the game...supercell clean the bug, some of the members whose active cannot play the game after the update last night...I have tried to uninstall it then reinstall again one by ine but still the same problem until now...clan war was onset yesterday but we cannot do some attack...",5
Good to kill time on but slow to build if ur fixed to not spend a dime on. Yet a very phoney game that takes no mental skill to play . This game is obviously easily hacked as some seem to be able to attack in situations where others can not and build their villages on privileges that aren't possible for others .,1
I cannot log in to my account when i logged my display is not touching and also the game...and automatically log out from the game its started today after i updated the latest version😠😠😠i restarted the phone also but its not working and there is no any errors in the phone ..other apps are fully okay and not lagging ..,1
I've been playing this game from last four years. And its really addictive. But the upgrading time of buildings and troops are so annoying. I think you should reduce the upgrade times of building for upper level townhalls. That will save a lot of time of players. Over all its a very fun game.,5
"First I really like the game but when my TH getting higher something is strange.why my enemy is TH 7 or 8 when my TH is 5, it's so unfair I can't attack them cause they are strong and if they attack me I always got destroyed,and if I find a same TH like me the trophy is only 7,9,10,11,14,15 so unfair and when the enemy attack me the trophy I loss is 30,25,28,20 really unfair plss fix this",1
"It's a decent game but I feel like it pushes you a bit much to buy gold etc to upgrade as the upgrades are really expensive along with this some upgrades literally take WEEKS to finish which I fully understand as they're high level upgrades but damn, shouldn't there be a way to speed them up through quests or something? Otherwise, great game to play in the morning and evening when you have spare time. :) <3",4
This is a awesome and excellent game . But after these recent update my game isn't opening . Whenever I open the game it crash or the screen be black so please check and make it perfect,3
"Highly enjoyable. Even more so with the recent update. I would be extremely happy if there was an option to chat between friends because everytime I try to chat with them, i would need to join the same clan and that is not private😅",5
Attacking one building at a time with dragons is ridiculous. Having a different method to where they can go to one point to another across the board will be appreciated.,3
"The pixel theme is ridiculous. That's the 10th birthday? It's so aesthetically horrible. Y'all should have made the other scenery free, the one that costs money. Really disappointing. We all expected more from y'all.",2
This game is so close to perfection but the later half is so long because a cannon takes so long to finish upgrading. The other problem is the amount of gold and elixir is small in the builder village,4
I suggest that they should fix the trophies for bh and th since there are lots of higher bh that are not ment to be there at that low trophies and also my other problem is i have high loots so that supposed to be lower tropies will be deducted to me but no it is just getting higher and higher that's ridiculous,1
"It's really one of the best game from what I have and at this time it's even getting better and better more. The challenge, the rewards, the raid weekend and so on. Thanks clash u always save my days",5
"5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟. This game is great although I don't know how to get hall pass 3. I might rage quit this game later on in the future, this game is somehow very realistic although some of the characters are wierd. but I will might update this comment someday in the future. The end.",5
"As far as i have experienced, this game has the worst matchmaking ever. Before I was at th9 and barely enjoyed my experience playing as a th9 when I kept on getting matched up with alot of th11 and some th10 and barely even th9. Kind of a bummer cuz I cant get matched up with some of my same level th and just wrecks up my whole experience in that moment, its still going as of now Im at th10.",3
"My account has been locked, and I am unable to recover it, and their agents are no longer helpful. They are very slow to reply, but no solution is given. They no longer take care of the players who contact them because many are playing COC again. If you don't recover my account, I will never play this again!",1
Plz supercell fix the problem. After recent updates the starts to crash when it opened. By showing black screen and also the game load lately. After loading the doesn't work properly for a while. So my to the team of supercell fix it out. Because we like the game and doesn't want to lose it out. Hope you will soon make it better. 😞😢,5
Im having trouble trying to recover my account This account has supercell id but i dont have the email. This game is probably my favorite mobile game. Ive played since 1 year after launch but keep losing accounts because they dont have a good way to change emails.,4
I have been playing for quite awhile and have enjoyed playing. Lost my account through inexperience but retrieve it easily. Overall a great experience.,5
"I have been playing clash of clans for most of my life and it is a great game with regular update's, and great graphics. Yet my only prbem is thet when ever I buy a 23 hour shield 🛡️ for 10 gems then I only get a 2 hour's shield witch leads me to being raided. Due to this I am struggling to gain trofie point's.",5
"Over the years, ( I believe i was 16, 17 yrs.old of age.) Im now in my 40s n abit🙄. I ve conquered tons of townhalls, earned hundreds of trophies. I ve spent way to money to buy gems in order to upgrade my armies to gain elixir n coins faster. A upgrade my armies my troops in order to to kick some serious butt n win. I've had alot of fun. It's now 2022, and I am BACK!!! HOPEFULLY TO KICK YOUR BUTT! HOWEVER, I HAVE TO WARN YOU ALL: THAT THIS GAME IS FUN N EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE!!!",4
Pretty good but one thing that never happened that started happening recently is the wall breakers will get though one wall take 2 steps and destroy the wall right next instead of actually progressing further in the base.,5
"After the recent update, the game always kicks me out after the loading screen. There's probably somethings wrong in the builder base. I also found out that some reviews here are complaining about the same reason. Please fix this Asap I have a war going on.",1
I've played this game for 8 years. The developers have cheapened the game by making it easier and easier. My account is already maxed. I've lost interest in CoC.,2
"I've played this game for over 6 years across multiple accounts, and yet it never ceases to entertain me. All the grind and customization really piques my interest, and the chief reason for why I have never gotten bored is the seasons which provide a really easy way to get magic items, which previously were very difficult to obtain. Best 5 pounds I've spent every month. Overall, this game is really good, interactive and player friendly from the tutorial all the way to max.",5
It is a good game. but the only problem is. when your in the builders hut map. when you go attack you get example 69. and the opponent has 47 HE wins. so please change it.,3
It is good enough to play but it would be much much better after fixing this..i.e.....while attacking if the connection lose it restart again...but the game play or attacking has been count😞... without any attacking or making any move and counting as lose/defeat 🥴...so fix this to reconnect our previous attacking mode if it is reconnect our net within a minute🤗 after this I would like to rate 5 star.....😁 Thank you,3
"This not review on this apps, this just a concern, i having trouble reviving my old account, reason i can log in on my gmail, i know my gmail and password, only 1 problem is , my phone and number are lost, on that number code will send, i try contacting the coc dev, but when i try they always says im trying reviving another account.. and thats my probem. If we can use the Facebook as a log in option , thats a easy one.. but can't , hope devs making it , like other game we can use Facebook.",3
"Hey Team, I cannot able to open the game, it shows my internet connection(mobile) is not proper but in backend all my other apps are working normally, game open only in the wifi connection... Kindly check this issue.",4
Try this game it's really fun but an issue is that it takes ages to build something up but a good game I recommend the devs to decrease the training and building I would appreciate if you done those things that are stated above but.... GOOD LUCK GUYS AND KEEP UP THE BEST WORK EVER! 🥰,5
"Wonderful game , the graphics and everything is good about this game I have lost my base but then just by doing a few verification code and signed into supercell, any network works.",5
"I love this game,best game in the world but the only thing about i hate is that the game pass costs 9 bucks to get.MAKE THE BARB KING SKIN FREE WHATS THE POINT OF HAVING A SEASON PASS FOR IT IF YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT GOSH DAMMIT,or at least make it so you can buy the skin for a cheaper price idk FIX IT everyone's complaining supercell ok. 5 star if fix on the bright side:)",5
This game is my whole childhood it's so good thank you so much dear supercell! But i just realized that defenses in this game are too strong for attacking even with max troops.This need to be balanced i do not just want to do electro dragon attacks.I want to try different combinations but when i try for example golem pekka wizard attack i have no chance for maxed defense villages.Please balance attacking.,5
"Game gets worse on every update. Years ago I could not put the game down, played for hours as upgrading only took hours. Now upgrading takes weeks so basically I only need to play a few minutes a week. Far better games then this now.",2
"From the last update of clan capita the game is always showing black screen and if it opens which occur rarely when I want to go to the clan capital it again crashes and shows black screen. I had made a huge progress and i don't want to lose this. I had tried all the tricks like clearing catch data,updating both Android system web view and chrome but it didn't work. I request supercell to pls look into this matter as many of players are facing this problem...",4
"I got to playing around with the friendly challenges within our own clan capitals. I noticed that the chat within my clan literally blew up. Within my clan, we communicate rather well and the amount of notifications is just....wow. I was wondering if you have considered creating a seperate button that opens to a ""Clan Capital Friendly Challenge"" database that holds the history and current opened challenges?",4
"Really fun until you get to town hall 10, everything just starts taking a long time to upgrade, which I understand that's how these games work but that doesn't make it more enjoyable.",4
"I am the leader of my clan. I updated the game today and since crash every time I login to the game. I have tried everything from clearing cache to uninstalling and reinstalling the game and even Bluestacks, to no avail. PLEASE HELP AND FIX THIS....",4
"Hey COC team, just wanted to tell this, the recent update you brought about after major update has so many bugs, some times the game doesn't load, the no of raid attacks remaining on main village some times shows 5 attacks, even after I completed all my attacks, please solve these ASAP.",1
I like this games. It has some problems such as my multiplayer villages building and all elements are not showing... Only heros/queen can show... Some time ago i am update this app but not well result. It has stay behind place.,4
"It keeps crashing even i uninstalled it the reinstall it keeps crashing i wanted to play this again for a long time and j can't play it anymore because it wouldn't launch, Please I know this game is old but please fix it. Device is: Vivo Y91c",5
This game needs to be fixed there are powerful people above my level that are attacking my base and they win all the time when I try to get revenge it says player has active shield you need to get the revenge button off bc it doesn't work and also put people that are on my town hall level which is lvl 6 so that the powerful people don't take my loot and destroy my base.,1
"Honestly one of my favourite games of all time, super good and I think with the new update it will be even better, the thing I love the most about coc is that there are literally no ads at all. It's really rare that a mobile game doesn't have ads and I think it's greatly good that coc doesn't have them haha",5
"The game is good I like it but idk what the hell is going on lately, even when I have perfect wifi and network connection toe game starts to tell me that I have wifi problems and while I'm attacking, the attack keeps going so I believe despite the sign I did my 100% but when I come back to the game it says that I only did like 85% when I clearly finished my attack. It has already happened twice and one more time today during the league! Because of that I'm losing and it's really annoying.",3
"Great game... Been playing for 5 years now and it was all fun and exciting with different kinds of design, potion or base but recently I encountered a big bug and i the screen goes blank or black.. And it always happen when Im login in or tap setting button or in war too which is a very big problem for a player who spend a lot of time into this game and now I don't wanna leave it coz of the hardwork i took to build my base so please fix this as soon as possible also thanks for the great design.",3
"For better playing, 1. Let the preparation time shortened. Because 1day preparation is too much long. 2. In next update, I hope we can messege our opponent wherein we can enteract in each other, I hope we can also send voice messeges for better and competitive experience. Thats all what Im expecting for the next update thankyou!",3
"The worst one every time i tried to attack you always gave th with higher level and trophy with lower level wasted my 2 hours just to attack one village and didn't even found any th with my level and trophy league and i quit your worst game you don't even deserve 1 star rating tho,",1
"Its a great game since 2013 but there's one thing I am annoyed at, the chat filter. This is sooooo annoying even though my chat are not bad words it still filtered! I hope they remove this feature because it ruins our strategies especially when we use clan main sometimes it filters the whole mail so mail is useless",4
I have a Samsung Galaxy 21s 5G Ultra with the Snapdragon 886 chipset my phone is state of the art this game by Supercell must be designed by complete idiots because it crashes almost every time since the update if you're going to make a cell phone game for the public you might want to test it before you let us download it so we can all watch it crash constantly while trying to play it and yet you won't return any of our money that we've invested in the game that's because the CEO doesn't care,1
"Epic battles, espirit de corps, tactics and strategy, characters galore! This game has it all. Keep your builders busy and make your daily stars and it's a fun game that doesn't have to be high maintence, but can keep you entertained as well.",5
The new update it causing the game to crash on my Samsung j6+. As the game start up it crash an I have items to collect before the time is pass. So can you fix it for me.....,2
"Wow, my Wi-Fi connection is strong and whenever I came to open my clash of clans account, it says I have a bad connection 😳. Please fix this bug and I'll install my clash of clans again. Also, make the matchmaking fair, I'm TH9 at Champion league, my opponents are always Townhall 10-11. Please fix it.",2
"We play this game 9 years . This game is amazing 🤩 fantastic ☺️, this game is our first online game.Just this things, it is became our emotion. But this update you free troops,spell,size machines cost.We will try to make our village best and max our base,but not this process everything free.I personally think now why i should play the game??.Every time past my days I think only who I loot massive ammount to max my base.So then i don't enjoy to loot more as training troops cost. please change it",2
Supercell for the love of God please fix the connection error message.. I lose attacks in wars because of this error and my teammates doesn't get the same error as mine even if their internet is worse than mine.. this error once it appears I just feel like smashing my phone.. 20% of my attacks are lost because of this error,5
It doesn't get updated even after downloads. The app fails to open and repeatedly shows a newer version is available even after updating. Hating this meanwhile this time. Very upset,4
"Great game just don't like how long it takes to upgrade things, also it would be cool if you could by gems with the gold or elixir, or you could have multiple gem mines and it could be in the home village and it could generate them with more mines like gold and elixir Don't have to take into consideration if you think it is a good idea",5
"I cannot top up in game it says,"" pending transaction request."" Wth is that it's been 1 month when i connect to supercell ID and boom! I want to purchase pixel skins!! My other games are top up-able but my COC the only problem",3
Played for a bit close to first release of the game and picked the game back up going on 4 years ago and love the game. Don't recommend if you are someone that can't wait on upgrades etc but if you can it's a very fun strategy game for those who like to dissect bases. I am also a dolphin that enjoys skins and the help from the gold pass too. If you get the gold pass its worth it. It's speeds a lot of progress.,5
I love this game soooo much because it's so addictive and can lure you in right away. The two good things I like about it are it has no ads and it gets better each update. So I recommend this game to anyone who likes to raid bases and upgrade their own.,5
"I am playing this game since 2015. Whenever i play the builder base, I am always ranked with higher builder base. I am currently at builder base 7 and I am always ranked with either builder base 8 or sometimes even 9. This is very unfair because higher builder bases have better and more defences compared to lower BH. Please fix your matchmaking in versus battles. It is very very unfair.",3
This game has 2 modes. War mode and build mode. My dad is a good player. He has 2 wizerds some giants and everything else but the purple guys. I love the look and fighting.,5
"After 10 years of clash, I think it's finally dying out. SuperCell really needs to bring back Global, And make it strictly language restricted or Adult Globals with proof of age. Just something, It would definitely bring back the life in the game. 90% of clans don't speak or do anything for days.. It's boring waiting on upgrades and raids with no conversations. No one really enjoys it like they did before, We really need a better way to chat with other people on the game. Please consider Global",5
Great game but i think something more to do ... 1. There's must be feature that we put our 6 bulider on 1 building for upgrade for 6x result. 2. One more request that supercell pls decrease the time on lab upgrading process. Thanks,1
"THE MOST OP STRAGETY GAME IN THE WORLD. no bug, no gliches,no hackers, no bots . so many new updates specialy the big CLAN CAPITAL UPDATE WAS OP. We can make so many accounts and play without any problem and now with no training cost it is so good.we can attack freely and upgrade freely .my base is a th 10 and i have so any attack strategies to use i like this game and recomend you to download this game. CLASH ON",5
"Most recent update removed content. My base incorporated all of the national flags, which were apparently removed without warning. Now I need to completely redo my base. Not sure why the flags had to be removed. Please bring them back.",2
"money money... you never stop like at some point let's give old players a max base for them loyalty, nothing I've been playing this game since 1day after the release, i took several breaks, and I am th12 not even max!! i play very well i taught lot of people wich i met randomly in coc lot of fundamentals and ways to think , i didn't get anything in revenge cause i Don't have money to buy th14, you getta be rich to play this game, so is every supercell game",1
"Great long-term game, but im posting because i didnt get the reward from the current giant and witch event, ive tried restarting the game but nothing seems to bw happening. I hope the issue will be resolved",4
These game is the best it should be a 5 star i love these game i really enjoy playing it's been a 2 years but i never get bored every day have a very good challenge for me.I really enjoyed playing but when you're town hall is 12 or 13 it takes to long to upgrade your defense and everything but it's a part of the game that's all I can say😊,5
"Great game but addictive, and if you want to catch up to past players it takes more then 7 years if you play normally, so start it if you have lots of free time and interest, otherwise don't.",5
"1 of the best games ever. I also have suggestion, make it so that we can add multiple builder on 1 construction, such as we can add 2 builder to a 1 minute construction/upgrade and it makes 1 minute into 30 seconds",5
"A very fun game. I like how you can make a variety of bases. It's also great that your time isn't fully spent on Clash and while something is being built or upgraded, you can do something else.",5
"Game is very good , and definetly love the game , but problem is after any update it lag and facing balck screen problem , hope supercell fix it in some days, then we can play it easily By the i suggest everyone please play and experience a wonderfull clashing experience with air ballons(i love ballons so much)❤❤❤❤",4
It's fun strategizing and just seeing how you can build and expand your base different buildings can do your base either better or protect it I'd say it's the five star game with ease.,5
"I must say its a hard earning game, the graphics is good and the upgradetime left is a bit unfair cuz like: you upgrade your fireworks to lvl 9 it'll took you completely 9 days to finish and you'll get is a bit improvement of the fireworks, also we need a free daily 50k elixir and 50k gold (Upgrades when townhall is upgraded) Please add it, I beg you Supercell, Thanks!",5
"This game has heavily detrorated over years. You have to be active always to farm trophies for moving up in league or else you will ran out of resource or trophies. One have to heavily depend on clan from cw, cwl, ccl. Active clans are only for old active players and not for others. This game has also acquired the freezing and crashing ability. You just can't log in your account easily even when linked to SCID, forget about lost account.There are also many scammers, abusers and inactive leader",1
"Ok having played since 2018 this game is really fun, progressing is ok leveling up is ok as well you can use money to upgrade in game and also to upgrade your troops and that does give an advantage to players although I wouldn't personally call it pay to win. In this game skill does play a very important role and no matter how much money you spend on the game without skill you can't win. Edit:Tysm for fixing the loading bug. Now i can continue playing it just like before. Still cant do 5 stars.",4
"It is very Nice game. The problem i was having in training armies which costs too much and i cant spend on my laboratary upgrades, but coc have improve it and i loved it. Thank You COC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"Bad builder base matchups, I'm trying to max out my base before moving to builder hall 6 but everytime i hit 1600 trophies i get matched up with almost max builder hall 6. Why can't I just match up with builder hall 5 with almost the same trophie count as me, it's pretty darn stupid just like the a.i of in game troops, do better. But yeah still 5 stars cause i like this game so much.",5
This game is amazing! If you want to have fun then this is for you. Best part is no adds. Edit: It can get kind of repetitive waiting for builders and training.,5
"It was a fun game to play anytime despite the fact that the stress of waiting overtakes you but other than that, it's still very fun to play but I still think it as a 4.5 for me though because you can't do points in the rating system which I think would be pretty nice for the rating but this game is fun and I recommend it to anybody",4
"I can't believe I just dropped this game for only 5 or 6 months and this game has progressed this much ! I don't understand even a single thing about clan capital and other new features, seriously hats off to this game. I recommend you this game, its really fun to play.",5
"I would love to rate the game 5 stars but in the past few months almost every time I enter the game my phone crashes and doesn't respond for about 10 minutes. Please fix this ,I really want to play but I can't.",3
"excellent game, but it is really hard for new players. suggest to strongly reduce time needed for buildings and so on for payers whose townhall level is below level 14. otherwise no new player will join, the game will go dead if there isno new player",5
"This game is good as well but my problem is that i deleted my game for few hours and when i download it there was no account of mine, i tried to log in as my account was connected with Supercell but it shows that verification code is sended but when i check there was no verification code sent i tried it many Times i updated my gmail as well but i don't get any verification code yet i checked my gmail it was alright there is no issue with gmail finally the verification code is not sended by Supercell when anyone tries to log in. i request to resolve this issue asap,1 week later and many more days no change in the game",1
Hey I have some issues of this game not to really.i want to purchase the shop but I cannot buy bcuz it's very expensive anlike other games.and the builder hall can you just update and add builder hut in BH and the training troops at town hall it's took to long can you make 5x speed? It's to boring if you wait until your troops is done and by the way this game is good keep it up!! Make this game better and better 🔰👉☝️🤯,3
"This is a great game but after the latest update, my COC bugged. The walls went invisible and the buildings, it triplles. What do you is the problem? My android device or the game? Please help me. I'm just giving a 2 star it for now.",2
"Verification code doesn't send to my email. I keep redownloading the game and logging in to my supercell account, But now i cant log in to my account I haven't got the supercell id verification code yet. I kept trying since last week. I've checked my spams and it isn't even in there.",1
I really enjoyed this game but.. I can't 3 star because.. I played my acc for 2 year's .. after changing my phone I couldn't recover my account With my google account bt 🥺..it always shows ..cheif ur village have been found. log in with your super cell id... I try more than 20 times but I never received supercell code .. Please fixed this bug...,3
"Great game, it would have been 5 stars of it weren't for the new update. The clan capital update is good don't get me wrong, it's the new sound effects of stuff and for some reason my base is now low quality, if this is a bug hopefully it gets fixed. If it isn't I'd recommend to put the HD stuff and the normal sound effects back.. EDIT: they fixed the sound effect issue but the base is still low quality but at least they fixed the sounds, I'll be giving it a 5 stars now.",5
I wanted to finally leave a review after playing for a few months. This is a really great game that is well developed that does NOT feel like a cash grab. The gold passes give plenty of value and the development team responds to the community.,5
"Scam. The game is fun to play and easy to learn but somehow I lost 1500 gems. Gems can be earned very slowly or bought with real word money. I guess that's how they get you. You buy gems, then l they expire and you have to spend more money to get them back.",1
"I have play this game since 2014. All the time i enjoy this game. But when in high league like titans, its hard to find the enemy who have same level with you. When i push my thropy into legendsl while im th 11, i found many enemy th 12. Then i maxed all building in th 11 and up my th to 12. But when i push my thropy again why i always found th13, th 12 so rare.. so weird..",2
"There should be more builders with less time. Difficulty level comes very early where too much time is consumed. As a result anyone can be bored too early. But if the gold, elixer etc and builder making both work early earnings and buildings, one gets happier while doing attacks.",5
It's pretty good but there are people getting gems for free from a bunch of websites so that kind of ruins the fun of this game And whenever I go to matchmaking I'm getting paired up with level 14 Town Halls at 1700 trophies there are also players who have level 11 town halls with no defenses or walls built which confuses me,4
I've played this game like years ago and now all of a sudden i decided to make a comeback and rock it up. I have had a great base and ummm i like this game a lot. They've added new things which are lil complicated but after you master em your good to go. Amazing game 🙌✌️🔥,5
Thos game has brouth me friends i can trust an care for i cant wait to see what comes next. I hope the are more upgrades deffences an troops on the way the game is vary supporting clues an other resources to help is on ower way but not to easy. Which I like,5
broken loading screen from the update or and it's my Android!! levels between each other exp......all searches has me searching continuously for a th like mine.... like every search they would show me that me and the enemies are all 2 to 3 town Halls apart Etc town hall 8 looking for one above and below but I'm town hall lvl 1o or 11 fight me. instead Im. I hope you understand my and thank you,2
"Hello supercell team, I have an issue regarding the game, When login page is complete,the whole screen turn into black only game sound hearable I've REDMI 8A device with 3 gb ram. Before it work properly but now it's not. Please solve this Thank you.❤️",3
Supercell I only had 1 problem it's the time when I try to connect my account to supercell id and the problem is that theres no code was sent to me in my mail I try it many times but nothing happens please help me about this I like the game I've been playing it for a year and I'm afraid that all of my efforts and the village process will gone so 🥺,4
Please let us use heroes while it's being upgraded. it's always a disadvantage if you dont have one of your heroes and we can't constantly join in clan wars because of that. It takes away the fun because most of the best attack strategies rely heavily on the heroes.I hope y'all consider this so that we can expirement all we want.,5
During this new update I am unable to log in the game. After the loading screen when I enter the game it automatically exit the game itself. Developers please do something about it.,1
"No game like Clash Of Clans can beat this game! My personal favorite game, graphics are great, runs smooth on my device, no lags and no P2W. The in-game currency; the gems can be obtained without spending real money, which is so far, the best thing in the game. Thnx to the devs who daily update the game and make it fun 2 play. I love CoC !",5
"I haven't really been one that could commit to game for a long periods of time I'd say the minimum was 3 weeks however from the time I saw this game on app store a year ago to now, I was and still am in love with this game. The only regret I have was not finding it sooner.",5
Absolutely perfect in strategy and fantastic story. This game has survived so many years and it seems it will still thrive. May this game forever go on for the amazing wins we had with our clans and the fantastic memes that made us all smile. 5 Stars still love this game.,5
"Absolute rollercoaster, filled with fun features and charming characters, clash is a game that ages like wine, it gets even better by the second.",4
The game is over all pretty good but there is one thing I hate the cost of higher level buildings and upgrade time and some times you wait for days or more then weeks otherwise I would have gave 5 stars,4
Been playing for years! Love the game! They should make an option to choose heros in builder base. New powers like teleport where you choose or invisible for 5 secs.,5
Been playing for 8-9 years only thing I've bought is builders. You can buy things but I haven't since I started. playing maxed out th12. I hardly play now due to busy but you can always just jump back on. Uses little data! Can't fault the game at all! Always great updates and new features and free rewards. Highly recommended!,5
I am playing this game for last 7 or 8 years & I enjoyed it very much And we all like this game too much. All the things in game is very well. But the troops training time takes alot of time . And i advised that it would be very intresting if supercell reduce Every thing upgrading time. THANK YOU SO MUCH DEAR:SUPERCELL.,5
I used to play this game for years but now the interface is so cluttered and the load time is so slow. There is so much going on. It used to relax me now this game stresses me... Used to be fun though.,1
Great until they lock you out. I've been locked out of my own account or else its been stolen and they won't help at all. Don't bother wasting your time progressing as if you have an issue they won't help.,1
"It's fun, upgrades get really long later down the line though. But honestly it's expected from a free to play game, they have to make money somehow lol.",5
"I've had years of fun playing Clash. My dad got me into it because he was addicted. I lost my first account, but I got back into it a couple years ago and am loving it. I'm in my dad's clan again, and I got my husband I to it now too. I like the mix of individual and group play. The latest update was awesome too.",5
Been playing for 6 or 7 years now. One of the most engaging games ever made and has kept me playing everyday out of both the great social aspect of clans and the great skill needed to attack as you progress.,5
"Clash of clans has improved so much since I played this game.It is less laggy and has speed up.But the only problem is that even though my Internet is quite good,sometimes the game said ""Your Internet connection is unstable.Please reconnect again."" Please fix the problem so that almost all players playing CoC give it 5 stars",4
"Develepers this game was good i liked it , but some times i request to troops but reqeust was send but not showing the clan chat , please fix this bug i have more then 5 times see this bug for me , i not select any troops and not cilck max ( box) I just request , i change other id to donate not showning req ?? So i have not get donation for war and attacks ! Please note it , but game was very nice , Thankyou.",5
"I wanted to give a feedback regarding SUPERCELL ID. If I want to shift my game progress to another the SUPERCELL ID, I can't do that. I have to stick to the SUPERCELL ID once I logged into that. I want to change the e-mail address of the SUPERCELL ID but don't want to lost the game progress.",3
"I give the game 5 starts because it is one of the best games I have played,but the training time is the problem in the game after just 2 attacks I have to wait 45mins I really that if you'll make it it is the best",5
"0 adds, a quality all good apps need. Not very pay to win which is also great! The only true bad thing is it can take, up to days for upgrades to happen. However very fun, id give it 5 stars f it weren't for the wait times.",4
"I love the game, and have been playing for a year or two now. However, every single time I try to open the game, it loads for a little while, the bar goes slightly past the word ""Loading,"" then sends me back to the home screen after a bit of lag. I don't know if there's a way to make the game load every time, but eventually I can play. Great game, except for the opening bug. Edit: The bug has been fixed and I can now fully enjoy the game. :)",4
"This game is good but I have a problem with time taken in training troops ,it takes too much time in training the troops . Please supercell team can you decrease the time of training troops .",3
Epic combat strategy game . Build your village train troops go to the battle. One of most popular game in the world. Fantastic troops and wars . Best Graphics. Good Game Overall. Problem : PLEASE FIX THE BUGS .,5
"Game crashes everytime I open it, I logged in using supercell but it prompts to login via Google play and the game minimizes and same cycle everytime I open the game. Can't even play the game!!",1
"Started playing in 2014/15.. addicted ever since, then stopped around 2017 then started back again now but this time new account. I don't play it like I used too just to past my time. Game still feels great, graphic wise as always amazing. Great job Supercell 😁",5
Is it a glitch? The cannons in versus battle goes straight to the defences when they could easily stay outside the range of the defence and attackother nearby objects. Goes for any troops amd not just cannons only. Pls corect it.,4
"Great game, I thought it would be like every other build your kingdom boring games but it wasn't. Fighting is awesome the defensive strategy is great as well. The only problem is that I recently had a glitch where I was playing versus battle in the builders kingdom when I got 43 percent and they got 8 and it said that I lost and got no rewards. This glitch works the other way though I got 24 percent and they got 36 and I won. Overall great game.",5
best game ever. no lag and nice graphics..must improve in giving rewards in every upcoming events for the convenience of many players.. must also provide new skins.. thanks and hoping for the best as always.,5
"Playing almost 10 years, not a bad game but it's getting busy. As if 2 bases wasn't enough, this new update now makes you take care of a 3rd base that does almost nothing for you, just one more reason to never put your phone down. Too much going on, too many side quests, events, wars, they pretty much want you to play 1-2 hrs a day, every day, or get kicked from your clan for not doing enough. They need to relax it a little, it feels like you have to log in 10x a day. It's becoming a chore.",3
Skill based matchmaking sucks in this game for an example when you try to find a player you're barbarians decide hmm the building or enemy in front of me nah the building and then when you spectate the enemy attacking you'll see that he has 6+ level units while you have level 2 units they had 20 I had 8 this game is a pay to win game like any average game no ads because they rely on you paying so you can become the most powerful player by buying multiple micro transactions.,1
"Great game but lately there was this bug that bothers me so much which is a bug when you're getting a personal break after too long without shield. I have a 16h guard shield but i can't attack other villages anymore because the game keeps telling me to do a break from the game. But I've already done that and the game still kick me out the game and won't let me attack other villages. Other than that its a very good game not gonna lie, i highly recommend it.",4
In my opinion this game is awesome strategy game. You can build your base and attack the enemy base. You can show your skills and dominate enemy. That's why you should definitely try this game...?,5
"I've been playing this game for a while and its still fun to play. I want to suggest one thing, can you put the message function where you can private massage your friend even though you're not in the same clan. It'll be a big help for the old and new players.",5
I will give you a 5star if you will make it shorter the time when we upgrade in each and everyone of the buildings and the chat box we can chat to our clan but to my friends aren't I hope that you will make it so that I can chat my friends. But the game is good and nice there has a new features,4
"For me I played this game years ago, and I saw when the game just had a update, so i saw a while ago i created a review for clash of clans, (AKA this review) any ways... clash of clans, Build a massive base to defend you treasures and some other new liquid... Attack Enemies with hordes of army's of Drangons, to Yeti's and also in the single player defeat the Golden Dragon, and also Tiny goblens, overall a good game, (10 outa 10, actually can only do 5 star but it's still 10 to me 💯",5
"Fek this game. These days the games always have a server problem. Every time i go for a attack,It's the message that reload the game. So far I got almost -100 trophy.",1
If you play the game right you start with gems and if you don't use it again they're like a cheating thing and if you don't use that you can use them later to defend your Castle to upgrade faster air like I just mine right at the first a bunch of mine so it's kind of taking a while for me to upgrade but clash of clans it's probably the best game I have it is an internet based games possibility so I give this game at five star you should too get it have fun oh and you can build clams,5
The reason i rate this game a 4 star is this thing the dark elixir some players just use lightning potions to easily get dark elixir so thats unfairr :( also the thing i disliked is that the upgrade time is way too long. The game is nice though it got gem mines to make the game fair and clock tower to make the building faster.This game is time eater too like the other games you supercell created but you tried your best supercell great job👌👌👌👌,4
"For the past months, Builder Base have been notoriously hard to grind for but the matching system quite improved. Last year most of of my opponents are rushed but their troops aren't so it's been a struggle, now I rarely matched with rushed Builder base, it's a big relief honestly. And with more events I can gather more loots. Keep up the goodwork supercell!",4
"a dark mode ui system would be a nice feature to add in this game due to the players used to the dark mode theme as it's nearly a necessity now adays. but great game overall and really really fun to play, thanks",5
Please make it as it was before where elixir was needed to cook armies and spells now the storage are always full and there is no reason for loot and attack. Making too many changes is not suitable as many people liked this game for what it was in the first place.,3
"This game is not good.firstly, the gameplay is not even fun all you have to do is upgrade your defenses and attack.secondly,not only COC but all other games made by supercell have no effort in making their servers better i cant play more then like 30 minutes and it disconnects my wifi is good and to make sure its not my wifi that i disconnect i go to youtube and it works perfectly fine.thirdly, they dont even update thatir games their so called ""updates"" are just bug fixes.Please fix all of this",1
"This game is my childhood favourite , please I have a suggestion to make , kindly take it under your consideration We can't practice different army upto it's full potential without heros , Hero upgrade takes longer hence they're not available always, please make a new update , we can use heros at same time they'll be under construction also , like how the laboratory upgrade works same should be for hero , it's would be very helpful for us to practice and try diff combination , please consider it",4
"This game is great, but I have really bad internet so when attacking, I will deploy troops but they won't come up in the replay and therefore I lose. You should be able to see what I have done offline or make some kind of an interpretation.",3
"This is a very nice game.I am playing it from many years. It has a very nice view with trees water falls and jungle.I like this game.it a very good quality. It is ane of the greatest game I have played.I like the characters , defence and attacking things in this game Cash of Clans. And last (I like this game).",4
The game is not starting from last 5 days dont know whats the problem but i found many players and my friends facing the same issue pleast @supercell solve this problem. In my device it crashes again and again and don't even get on loading screen,3
"Game is awesome i am playing it for almost 3 years.U guys don't forget to entertain with new updates like first builder base,clan war,clan games,clan capital,new troops, new town halls,super troops.I was even feeling hard to collect elixir but u made it easier by removing elixir cost for training troops.Only thing I am it's going worst is clan capital. Some people rush their base,some upgrade only after maxing their defence and troops. I am the second kindof guy.But now in clan capital different",5
Now what I can do... Game is not loading even my internet connection good and this not happens only one time.. Before I upgrade my th 10 game is opening but when I upgrade my th 10 to 11 damn game is not opening and 5 days boost totally wasted and after 5 days boost game opens🥺... My anger is on another level...,1
"When you reach a high league enemies that you find on multiplayer are 1-2 TH higher than you are and it will take roughly 30 mins of searching for opponents to find a TH same as yours, But the loot, throphy is so low",1
"This game is rlly great tho , i played this game since last year but i quit and now i re-installed it and im disappointed now bcs I can't recover my account. I connected my account in fb but it seems that there is no Facebook connect in the settings. I hope they put it again:)",2
"everything is good, but something is missing in the event tree, like 10 years of COC etc (I don't know the name), it doesn't have a limit, don't you, because there is one YouTuber COC who told you that there is a limit on that, so we are the players long time can't remember something like that, please cooperate SUPPERCELL",4
Game has to reload every time you switch from cellular to wifi or vice versa. So you're screwed if your in the middle of an attack and your phone decides to connect to wifi.,3
"I have played this for a long time and I would love to have global chat back. And I LOVE the clan capital update, it's so fun to play because it's a mix of builder and home bases. It was actually a subject of my dreams that I thought would never happen.",5
The developers have ruined the experience of the game. The heroes algorithm makes your hero walk out of their logical scope inside the game. UI also needs improvement.,1
This game is absolutely a master piece. But there's one little tiny problem which is we need more defensive towers and traps overall it's great!,5
"Nice update. But still need some improvements. Reduce the upgrading time of the troops, defences and especially heroes. And let players boost more than two super troops.",3
Everytime i tried to attack to increase my trophy most of the enemies have higher town hall than me but the trophy is lower than 10 and also if someone attacks your base the stars deducted is too high compared to what you can get when you attack,3
"The gameplay is smooth and flawless, furthermore, the graphics are stunning and the whole idea behind this game is great. One thing that I really love about this game is that developers are listening to the community. That is the reason, why the game is so balanced and well designed.",5
This game requires you to be STUPIDLY patient unless if you have money you can buy gems to skip some upgrades/building or buy more builders to speed up the process but when there's special days they give some free stuff the troops are unique with heroes and spells this is a decade old base building game I still enjoy,4
"Electro dragon's damage when destroyed doesn't make sense, i.e. it does not significantly damage building. i.e. lightning strikes after getting destroyed are spread across rather than on the preferred target. So i gave only four stars.",4
"It's a good game but it's a pay to win game like Books of fighting Cost 925 gems if u buy it in a trader ,but if your lucky u can buy it for Real Money ,only problem is that if u sell your extra book of fighting or your runes it will only give u 50 gems ,like it cost 925 gems for a book of fighting while ifbu sell it it's 50 gems make changes about it I'm currently Th 10 I also bought battle passes ,I buy offers if there are cheap and good items in them , please make changes",3
"I am upgrading to TH7 today. This game is both fun and frustrating. When choosing cities to battle, the game offers cities that are so much of a higher level than you can beat that you have to pay 250 gold to see the next city. You may spend thousands of gold before coming to a city your size. City defense buildings are meaningless against attackers 2 or 3 times your size. So, you go up and down if you play enough. Play too long and you shut down for 6 minutes. Stupid!",3
"Originally 5 star review but now - NO. Clan Capital was a flop, we didn't need it or ask for it, confusing and goofy as hell, everything is way out of proportion and the art style looks cheap as hell. Stop overcrowding the game.",3
Reaching th13 is hard and now u give me th14 as the one I will attack this is just outrgours and utterly bullshiet. Its only fun I. The beginning and it will be boring throughout this is game will take u months in finishing your build when u reach th11. In summary I don't recommend you playing this game it will just corrupt you just like it corrupted me in buying unrenfundable battlepass this is abullshiet game dead as hell silly piece of shiet game.,1
"A fantastic strategic game.got hooked since a friend introduced it to me👊🙏 For beginners,pls upgrade each item,spell and weapons before upgrading your hall further..do not rush. Also more friendly challenges improves your strategy..Join a clan now👊😎",5
I've been playing the game for 6 years. Was a great game. With the new updates game keeps crashing can't even play. Tech support is no help.,1
"This latest update is horrible. Socialism at it's finest. Everything is either free or greatly reduced in price, which has made this game easier and less enjoyable. This game has been getting progressively worse thru the years. Very disappointed in this newest update.",1
Please make the game switch internet connections without loosing your attack... Because while attacking if my wifi is gone no matter how fast I switch to mobile internet I won't be able to resume my attack... Reconnecting and resuming where left is impossible... Please fix this...,3
"Please everyone support me upgrade it ..... We want justice.....#CHAT:- chatting options is very old... make it voice chat option..it will be more easy to conversation with clan mate as compared to text chat.(traditional vs modern) It's very hard to lead a clan...in text messages... So, I kindly request to COC team to solve this problem.",4
"Hold up. The new update is trash. You can change anything else, just don't change the recruiting of troops with elixir and d-elixir, that's shizz was gold. Its literally OG. Cause right now it seems boring to even play COC, with this new update. It more fun when it's more challenging 😭😭💔",5
"Love it, had no issues playing it. BUT for last two days, my game can't be open. When I click the game icon, black screen appears and then it crashes every time. Please fix it. I'm not worried about my account, i have it backed up by supercell but if possible i would like to play the game 😅",3
"It started out as a great game, and still is, but it's not as casual as it used to be and has become more and more childlike and complex. I still love it, just miss the days without all the sweats who grind all day.",4
Its very fun and not noring at all bu the one part that i dont like is that i takes up to more than days to finish upgrading and i really dont think that more builders should cost that much gems *500* but the more builders you have the more thingd you can upgrade but overall its a very good game,4
This game is very good. I've played it for a long time now and have been a part of it ever since it's early days. The updates are very entertaining and challenging and this game just keeps getting better and better. I've had times where I had to leave the game because I felt I was going too slow but I've come back and just at the right time. The addition of the pass is something fresh and I find my self playing this game just like I did before. Good jobs devs. Keep it up!!,5
Build army. Raid opponent. Steal loot. Upgrade troops and defences. Repeat. Join clan then repeat all of the above in organised wars. Keep attacking and keep upgrading. Each month you can buy the very affordable gold pass to speed things up. Endless fun!,5
"Please sort out the latest update!!! I have been made to update the game today and now I cannot play as it crashes as soon as it loads, I love the game and played it for years and will give 5 stars again once it is sorted out please.",1
"I would say this is the best ever building game not only buolding game you got to have many choices of attavk strategies. Team up with Clanmates for clan capital, clan war, Clan war league And best of all clan games. This game gives you an Best experience even if you free to play If you got A money I suggest buying the gold pass in the start of a season and Buying the builder Pack If your new in the game",5
"Verry great game. Verry little bugs happen, when bugs happen they get patched quickly. Other than slight bugs once in a blue moon its a perfect game, paitence is key. Would love to see some kind of mini game situation for when every builder is buisy and nothing else is happening. A daily base attack challenge mini game that gives rewards would be awesome, basically games to help farm potions, gems, capital gold and more, similar to the campain but on a daily rotation with different rewards. 5/5.",5
"This game was so exciting for me to play since i love strategies game so much. Its easy to understands. And we need a lot of patience in this game since every upgrade sometimes need 2 weeks to finish. Its a bit bothering me when we upgrade our town hall, and the walls became so expensive. Like. Bruh..",4
Very recently the game is very slow and resources heavy and sometimes it crashes on startup please fix I can't get my account and play the game well I can but I have to start at square one and get back on where I was before it crashed which is very difficult because I was a th10 PLEASE FIX!!!,3
"5 star because since I downloaded this game I haven't seen any bugs nor anything else that makes the game unplayable, I've been playing it all week and it's a pretty good game all around, tho I have to say, why such long time just to upgrade town hall, or any building in general?",5
"Though the upgrades are a bit too long when you get high leveled town hall, i like the fact that you can play the game anytime, like you dont have to be online in this certain time with a duration on how long you have to stay in the game or when you start you arent needed to play for like an hour. The graphics are insane and the game itself is just catchy, its a type where you can just keep the app in your phone and not even think of uninstalling it.",5
"I've been playing COC since 2014 and I had a great time playing this game, I rated 3 Star because of the new update that removed Elixir cost from troops training. The removal of elixir cost for troop training make this Game too easy to play, back then you need to raid someone base and get elixir so you can make troops but now, raid opponent base feel less enjoyable knowing that you don't really need elixir anymore. I hope Supercell read this and do something",3
"I remember this was the first online mobile game I've ever played...And I still play it without any issues...It doesn't have any cheaters,I still haven't faced any bugs,it doesn't force you to purchase money for the game...So in my opinion, this is the best mobile game ever...",5
"Very amazing game and experience. It's upgrades, strategies, attacking and now capital gold is just making more addictive. One tiny thing: the upgrades in this game consume a lot of time. Other than that, it's an anazing with amazing features and ne being a coder knows how complex code can be when u code every troop separately and combine them!!!",5
Honesty this game is great. It runs well and has decent graphics. I can only list one problem in that everything takes so long to build and upgrade. Other then it's pretty good!,4
"Game concept is good and it's nice game . But security is very low. I have one experience. If someone knows your mail id which connected with supercell mail id. If anyone chat with supercell helpdesk team for mail change for that account, Supercell helpdesk team why not taking confirmation that you are the owner of that supercell mail id they need to sent to one time code to confirm with that person who asking for mail change , that should be first security step.",1
I love the game but later in the game upgrades takes a long time So I'm probably not the only one who thought of it but what if if you have a another builder available you can have two on one project that makes it going faster 1 =1.0x 2=1.5x 3=2.0x 4=2.5x 5=3.0x,5
"I have 1 starred this game from 5 star just bcoz it gets reload whenever the connection is lost and don't get continue the attack where it got left, this is a major problem which needs to be fixed, due to this some important attacks gets lost 😡😡🤬🤬.",1
Im playing this game for 8 years i have noticed that you have changed so many things that we are expected. Now i like to say that if you bring this feature that even if we are upgrading our heros we can use it in our war and clan war league please understand this it would be usefull to us because when we are upgrading heros and using war it is difficult to handle a maxed 14 bases so please 🥰,5
I'm fed up with it I lose always 40+ trophies I get only max 20 other wise 1 to 10 The game is great but I got 10 to 20 trophies only some time it increases but every time I lose 25 to 40 trophies in every attack that not fair,1
I'd like to start off by saying I do really enjoy playing this game... when you have your heroes to attack with. And that's why I give it only three stars. Later on in the game you spend months (and that's with the goldpass) upgrading your heroes per townhall. You feel useless every time they're down for upgrade. Honestly just let us use them while they're upgrading. Because right now the game becomes an unenjoyable farming experience while you wait on your heroes to finish. For MONTHS...,3
"I played this game and it is super. It is nice and relaxing to. I am encouraging people to play this game. Only thing is what ever you want to do you have to spend coins and exlair in thi game, and there is not much to do at certain times. I am thinking of an upgrade for this game.",4
"Last update has ruined the game. There are no flags, no exir is needed to train troops, wall hp has decreased. As a result the game has become less competitive and less enjoyable.",3
"This game is marvelous. This gives me grateful time when playing because it allows you to think logically on how to attack other base. Moreover this game is fun to play. Only thing that I did not like about this game is the upgrading system because it takes to much time to finished one upgrade, the higher the upgrade the longer it takes. But it is a fun game. Obviously!",4
Even if you have a safe account a random player can hack your account. And when non purchasing players try to recover their account then no help from supercell. Only players who purchase can get their account back which is not fair play. Account security needs heavy work from the developers.,2
"Why does the game keeps crashing with a black screen everytime I try to open the game or click any button inside the game?Happening since last year's Novmber.Been playing for 6-7years,never faced any issue.Even in play store there are lot of reviews pointing this issue. Fix this! There are so many reviews pointing this issue, still you're not fixing it or doing anything! Don't you care about your players Supercell? Seems like a massive uninstallation wave is coming soon if this continues.",3
I actually like this update. Removing the training cost means i can now attack using any stratfies without worrying about not making back the training cost. Now i can totally focused on how to attack efficiently using any troop I want. Plus this changes will definitely good for the longer run of the coc.,5
"Past 2 months , this app is having bugs. Although my internet connection is excellent, it starts buffering in the middle of my attacks. Therfore its no morr fun. Do look into it",1
"Graphics are very creative and entertaining. The buildings the weapons and everything else are so life-like yet cartoonish. The sceneries are on a checker board ""village"". All the characters and setting are unique and collaborate well. It's a game of strategy that takes the ""edge"" off mind-numbing plotting attacks or defense strategies. A decent outlet for anybody with general anxiety or just bored.",4
"This is a fantastic game! I personally love it. There are many good features which make the gameplay engaging but I guess it would be much more better if there would be a feature to trade coins, elixer and gems with our friends in the game and I am pretty sure everyone would love it!",5
This game is amazing. I love playing it. I am playing it since 2019. But the only thing is that it takes 5 to 6 years or more to reach max town hall. That is why I'm giving it four stars. Otherwise for those who love building or strategy must play this game. I love this game,4
Great game. Didnt want to play it at first but my brother got me hooked a few years back. Loving the latest update though. 1 complaint... About 3 updates back my game started stuttering and freezing for short periods causing me to loose focus and lose some attacks. Please fix this as it is really irritating. Still 1 of the best strategy based games i have ever played,4
This is the best game ever i played. I found everything what i want in a game. Build a village in our own is a interesting concept and there is no rules to build a village. Totally excellent and the legendary game.,5
Worst support team.. I tried to recover my old id and they banned me for 31 days. I deleted my email account so I couldn't able to login I asked them for help and provided available details about my account and their stupid agent thought am trying to retrieve someones else account and trying phising. Ok then keep my current account and have fun am not playing this game again. Thank God I didn't made any in-game purchases.,1
Hello supercell I have something to say that about capital hall. There are total 5 attacks in per weaks in one round and we cannot use our attacks after first round when all 5 attacks is finished so this is not the best features in this capital hall there must be 5 attacks per round then it will be better raid .. I hope you will notice out my review Thanks supercel .....,4
A very wonderful game but too much time to upgrade any building and also too much trophy struggle. It is a good game for timepass.,4
"Edited this review from 5 to 2 stars... It's been too much now, the game is crashing a lot, can't even open the game and do a simple task of opening the CWL map, before the Clan Capital update as well it was crashing but I kept my patience, but after the update the crashing problem became 5×, so can't bear this problem anymore, making the experience of my most favourite game a nightmare, can't even look at my home village zoomed out for 10 secs without crashing. Am disappointed SUPERCELL.",2
"Very fun game to jump onto from time to time. Can be very difficult and lengthy however, if you start now you will probably never get to the max Town Hall however, unless you grind for hours daily for years.",4
"It's a really good game I've had multiple accounts across the years I've played it and it's been fun no matter, even when I had to restart because of lost accounts, I've played the game for about 7-10 years",5
"I have played COC since like 2016 and it is just awesome. The raid weekend system is fantastic but the exchanging of raid medals qith the dealer are not, the most bought item is probably the 1 million builder elixer for upgrading the battle machine or canon cart for otto For this reason many people don't care that much for the raid medals if the shop had other items like books (hammers would be too OP) for like 1000 medals for a normal and maybe 2000 for a book of heros that would be fantastic",4
I have been playing this game for over 4 years still love it .the problem is why do super troops cost so much for just 3 days i use sneaky goblins and super wall breaker as farming army so I have to buy these two for 50000 dark elixir instead of upgrading my heroes or troops please fix this make the time period a little longer or make the cost a little lower,5
Awesome game have been playing for 10 years. It's my go to mobile game that will keep you coming back for more. My only problem is that it often crashes and sometimes won't update but that could just be internet issues. Anyways I love the game but the crashes and it not installing sucks.,5
"I've been playing this since release, it is great. But one big problem, lately I've been experiencing crashes when I click attack, and when it doesnt crash on that moment, then it will crash when it ends (where the stars appear) This situation is okay in a casual battle, but in clan war/clan capital raid, it's not okay. The game counts my attack but I don't even get my troops deployed. It sucks",2
"I really like this game!this is the best game that i played ever, i enjoyed playing this game best stress reliever but sometimes there's a problem but it's okay. please fixed some issues as soon as possible. great game!",5
BEST GAME IN THE WORLD 1000000/10 I RECOMMEND THIS GAME.... now this game is good but it's a waiting game soooo if you have spare time or if your on work and you get a 10+ minute break this is the game for you now at the start things are fast but ones your town hall is level 9 or 10 things will get slow in a way you'll be able to do raid and stuff but upgrading and building things will take a while but I recommend the hell out of this game it is the best game ever 1000000/10 best game I love it.,5
"Removing national flags was a big mistake. I'm very proud of representing my country and you just took that away for what, to separate reality from fiction. When you bring back flags you'll have my stars back.",1
Top notch the best been free to play for like since march you do the math ( im not american). Its a good game over all and dont wanna get to burnt out with it. Im an th9 with a th6 as dump acc its very good so far gotta say i dont like that it doesnt cost to cook stuff but hey doesnt mean i gotta make a fuss about it right? I like judo sloth and klaus gaming skl.,5
All I want to say is that the versus battle in Builder Hall is so unfair. Like i always fought a higher builder hall than mine and more upgradable defense. And the upgrade of each building is too much expensive. And the elixirs and gold battle rewards make it at least 12hrs instead of 24hrs. It was so difficult to upgrade and i always wait too long to get a versus battle elixir and gold rewards.,5
PLEASE LET US USE HEROES WHILE UPGRADING. Game is fun until youre TH10 and UP. Imagine youre TH12 it takes several months just to maxed out your heroes. Several months of boring attacks. It doesnt make sense. You upgrade your heroes so your attack would be effective but you cant use heores because youre upgrading them. Lol,1
"I had installed COC 10 years ago, but wasn't able to retrieved my account because it was under IOS account (Apple). Now, i am using an android. So i need to go back all over again from TH1 just to play the game. So sad.",4
"Great game! Just takes too much time... I have been playing this game on and off since release, and I always end up coming back to it. What stops me from playing here and there is the amount of time it takes to progress. Since release I've only made it to TH 11. It's hard to balance real life with this game if you want to progress fast(unless you use the micro-transactions). Gave it 4 stars due to the fact that it takes forever to progress if you don't play 24/7.",4
"Every time I try to use the boat to go to the builder base, my screen turns black and my game crashes shortly after. This also happens when I try to open the season menu (where you see all the tiers & such). Edit: The issue still persists and it's gotten worse. I can't even get into the game anymore. I've tried contacting Super Cell and I tried all troubleshooting solutions they listed. Nothing works.",1
Hello Coc Team... You are doing a grt work by providing us such a wonderfull game. I love this game and I am continuosly playing from the last 5 years and still enjoys the game. As i was playing i noticed that when we upgrade anything in the game it just changes colourand become slight powerfull. I just want to suggest you with every upgrade the look of the buildings and wall should also be changed. it should look little more difficult like a dragon statue on every walls top or a tiger.,5
"Very nyc game..., used to be..but after the recent update it stopped working properly. Screen is going black.., every time i change between any kind of village or transition, can't even play..since 99%of times it does not start properly, really annoying, and sometimes idk why after trying many many times id starts 😔🤬.. Please.... Do something about it fast!..... Like soon please... Or else just close it... Save ours and yours.. Everyone's time! 🙁",1
"Form the last updated of clan capital the game is always showing black screen and if it opens which occur rarely when I want to go the clan capital it again crashes and show black screen. I had made a huge progress and i don't want to lose this. I had therid all the tricks like clearing catch,data, updating both Android system web view and chrome but it didn't work. I request supercell to pls look into this matter as many of players are facing this problem.🙏😟😥",1
"Decent, but the second ""Builder Base"" they added a while ago to help keep us occupied while you are building an army or doing upgrades is now useless. I've had that 2nd base maxed out for over a year, and there's literally no more to play for. My stocks are full so if I win a battle, it just tells me my storage is full and I get nothing... But they keep adding to the normal base. So I still play, but not nearly as much.",3
Was great. But not now. Ever since the update the game has been bugging out. I try to battle someone and then it crashes. I reload the game and it says I'm in a battle but I never once seen who I was battling nor was I able to send troops. So 4 battles in a row I lost because the game crashed before it even loaded. Iv been playing the game for more than 8 years and now I'm thinking about deleting it because it's no longer fun to play. And people wonder why nobody likes or does updates.,2
"I am having trouble loading the 1990's arcade game. For days it loads the menu screen, and when I choose to play it leaves with a ""connection error"".",3
"It's a fun game no doubt, but edge close to a pay to win. You can get very far like everyone else but if you don't spend real money to skip upgrades it takes forever. I've been playing close to 3-4 years I think without even spending real money. Now I'm close to upgrading my Townhall to 11. It's a very very long journey.",3
This is a really great game and really fun just one problem me currently at th 10 i suck at attacking before th 9 attacks aren't that hard but after that i personally suck at strategizing it's me that suck but there should at least be strategizing tutorials also it takes days to upgrade at th 10 like 5 days for an inferno tower it's ridiculous that said with many other th 6 and th 7 acounts i have a lot of solo wars and i am a proud clan leader i highly recommend this game a few flaws but 10/10,5
"We need more rewards in the incoming seasons, I finished all the rewards in a few days then I found nothing to do until the next one, so add more catalysts and excitement! Finally, please shorten the time it takes to build things, the time makes the game very boring.",4
This game is perfect for people with patience and people that want to have something to do in your free time. When you get attacked you have a 12 hour shield but every time you attack it first takes away 3 hours then 5 the 7 etc. There is a bit of a pay to win aspect but it ruines the fun of building it up your self and you only get a bit of fun by doing so.,4
"Last version of the game without the new features of new base. The game is working on my phone. But when it get into the newest version, I experienced black screen. After the loading screen of COC it will turn into black screen, but there's a sound of the game which totally the game is in the village, but I cannot see and tap the village because of the black screen. Please fix this issue, and I will change my ratings.",1
It's a decent game..main object is to kill your enemies with kindness! (By design) Feed them loot they attempt to gain while your defenses kill them off. Protect the defenses. Protect your town hall with defenses.Gaining 1 star off your base and some loot is better than completely getting stomped but that happens to. Vevenge option and replay attacks to your base helps! *Vikings Gone Wild* was the best though..No other game can compete that I've tried and still looking. VGW 4life :)(: NrCase76,4
"I am a returning player from 2018 and i have now played for a month, as usual the game is awesome. But i found a bug that was also there when i stopped playing the game in 2018. This happens when I request for troops and close the game or due to internet issues the game is forced to reload, but when i check the cc i find i am short of troops even if someone has filled my cc. This bug has been thre for long, so please fix this Edit- the bug is fixed now so yeah 5 stars and awesome content",5
Been playing for 5 years now! Only thing i want to say is this game is nostalgic and very much alive thanks to the developer team for the constant new engaging updates. There are some flauds but the team works constantly towards them. But one thing that always annoys me is the removal of global chat. Tha players really want it back. Rest is very good!,5
"I really enjoy the game, been playing for many years, and one thing they removed, I personally think they should add back is global chat. It was a great way to learn things and be able to build up a clan. It was very useful and there was always ways to report bad behaviour and words that are inappropriate get bleeped. The things that they have added seem very good, haven't really had a chance to use the supertroops and the clan capital but it seems very good from what I have seen.",4
"It's an existing game that needs a lot of concentration thinking and tactics and it's very interesting the moment you start playing you can't stop , also it gives you the opportunity to know how other players think react and compleat challenges joining clans is also a plus the only thing is that it takes a very long time to upgrade anything or create an army starting from ten minutes and going up to four days and that's kind of annoying otherwise everything else about the game is booooooooooooom",5
"This game is amazing, it not only allows you to get better with attacking your practices and can give you resources from it but it's not pay to win in a way. It was very friendly with others in the way it's kind of pay the win that gives you a short boost and you can buy Jem's which they even give you deals which can give you resources bunch and makes it quicker to auptrade, This game also allows freedom of base design and attacks which suit other players better or worse depending on the person.",5
"I installed CoC to play with my friends but everytime I open it, it crashes. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarted my phone, turn off and on my WiFi, but nothing is working. Edit: I've checked other reviews and lots of people are having this issue. Supercell, please fix this. Edit: guy fieri is a cool guy. He's cute",5
Personally I love this game. I've uninstalled it in the past but only because I donwload a lot of games yet I always come back to this. People always complain it takes too long to upgrade after a certain point but I personally don't mind it as I know when I come back I'll be able to raid and upgrade more,5
It's been great until I maxed out. Now we have an upgrade that isn't exciting at all. Like versus we can't pick our offensive or defensive ops. Our reward is a batch of metal for spending. Not fun at all!! I'm still maxed on my 2 characters. 18 months is way too long for home village up grades.,4
"This game is amazing! The amount of effort and creativity you put into it makes it amazing! I love attacking in all 3 villages (tho builder base needs an update). The clan capital was so hyped and amazing, the attacking system makes it so fun to attack with friends! Also the clan games are so fun, they give you rewards and the quests are never boring. The golden pass is so rewarding, it gives you so many runes and even a very cool hero skin. I can't describe how much i love this game!",5
"It was Great before the update but now that you update it now it's not really the way I liked it and it's not good buildings don't make noise anymore,troops sound different,the new features I don't really like them because they will take a lot of time to also upgrade,if you can atleast change some of the new features for the old ones it would be good 👍Again it's good, only the new update it change and I kinda don't like it. Edit:The troops do make noise now it's because I had to reload the game",4
"I was a regular user of this game since 2016. For some reason I had uninstalled this. And again now I've reinstalled to get that nostalgic feelings back. Now idk what's wrong is going on with supercell. COC used to be one of the top games once. The game is crashing automatically whenever I'm trying to open. Same whenever I'm clicking on clan capital. Supercell need to focus on this major problem asap. Before we, users give up.",2
Fun game. Playing on and off for years. Just started to play again. Level 10 or 11 house and lots of resources waiting for me was cool. I remember how to play but it seems like a lot of updates have happened which I will have to learn all at once to be able to casually play to win.,5
"Much better than mobile legends, I experience less lag than other MOBA games. The only thing I hate in this game is the working days of upgrading the equipment and such. Some of them are taking up 3 days just to get updated to the next level 🤣. It's frustrating.",5
The revenge system sucks. The opponent always seems to have active shield and there is no way to know when shield will go down. Waited 4 days to take revenge and the opponent still has active shield. Fix this stupid thing. It's not like your player base is increasing. This is the most in demand request from the player base and also reduce the time taken for upgrades,1
"I like the new updates and the content of the game, but for some reason every time I try to load up the game, it immediately crashes my music app (YouTube music) and no other games or apps do that, which means it absolutely eats all my phone's processing power, and it is not well optimised. Also, builder base reaches a point where it takes way too long to progress without spending gems or real money, purely because of how disproportionately expensive walls get, it's ridiculous. Otherwise great.",1
"Fantastic Game. Doesn't have any pay walls to hinder your progress, it's all optional extras. A very fun way to pass time. A Daily log in before bed make sure everything is in order, I love it.",5
It is really good game and everything but I wish that supercell can make more games like this on. Well the only one thing bad is that you only get 2 builders and if you want to get another one it costs 500 gems and when builds get in higher levels it will take more time to upgrade. But else in my opinion it is my best game ever,5
Great game love it have played it for years however on my darker village I hate how I can only place walls in sets of five and I can't place them individually it messes up my layout as I can't have the walls where I want them and it is really hard to not leave gaps and I am really struggling to work out a layout that works all because of only being able to place the walls in fives it ruins the whole experience as I just get frustrated at the game while trying to make a layout that will be good,3
"Amazing fun game, this is so fun building up your base and upgrading everything till it's maxed out. It does take quite a bit of time in the later upgrades but it's nice to activate those before you go on holidays or something.",5
"It's really interesting game.iam playing most time , thank you super cell. Iam really enjoying nd exited to playing this game. And rewards also giving well. We have support to upgrade and maintenance all the equipment nd all. And easily connected to friends and take enjoy the game. And here all army's are such a amazing, wonderful, I like all the troops. And updating timer is perfect. I am not playing other game..on my phone have only one game COC. And no need to spending that much time. TQ..",5
"I've been playing this game for 7 years and what I have to say is that the game never gets old.Its so fun to play especially if you have multiple account.But, the thing is, if you have a high level base, you have to wait more time for the upgrades.Overall I'll give e this game a 10 out of then because it's not pay to win like most of the mobile games.You can easily become the best player in clash of clans , it just takes patience. Very good game 👍",5
"It is my fave game I literally love it The game is so cool and I can only think of a few improvements: 1. Just like in hayday and boom beach (yes at 1 point I have played your games supercell although I hate everdale), you should get a statue to recognise that you have a supercell ID (that one is optional) 2. There should be global chats again 3. The time and expense should be reduced because when you get to a lvl2 inferno tower it takes 5 days to get to lvl3 though that it can go to lvl9.",5
"Brilliant idea and game overall, but a woeful support system in place. If your account gets stolen, good luck trying to get it back. Simply Google the amount of people who have tried and received bans for attempting to get their account back. Do not, under any circumstances, install this game with the intentions of playing long term until they update the support system and account security. People can steal your account with next to no effort or information, and that's it, all progress gone.",1
Takes way too long to collect resources late game and the buildings cost too much. It's fun but i have been playing for years and have yet to get upgraded to higher tier bases. Definitely set up play to win.,4
"A good game, with good graphics. Not pay play a all. But you can spend some money to enhance your game a little faster or get new skins. Which isnt that expensive also. A game for the long run. Been playing for about 5 years. And every now and then new stuff gets added. Like what Supercell is doing. I love the new updates. The Clan Capital is a new fresh idea on the game. The new update where all troops are trained for free are also heaven sent. Thanks for making the game more enjoyable.",5
I've had a great time playing this game for years ups and downs with loss of village but now everything is going well with my new village. New troops and heroes new upgrades.. 7 years later and I'm still addicted to Clash... as over 6-26-22 started my 3rd account just to enjoy the nostalgia greatest strategy action play ever,5
Fun game. Much too long and resource costly to upgrade items. I quit for a few months at a time because it's tedious trying to upgrade if you're not hardcore dedicated and playing hours at a time every single day,3
"This game is awsome I had made many accounts and clans of my own on this game, but a problem disturbs me whenever I open the game this game shows black screen and goes back to main screen, but not just this happens my phone also gets laggy and get automatically get restarted, this happened to me many times sorry to supercell that I have to quit the game.",2
"This game acheiving new heights, in recent times it experiences great changes in it. And now more and more players are playing it with varied interest because now it works in its most backward areas and it works it's best to improve itself. Really now this game is coming with new ideas and expectations. I really want to appreciate their hard work! Keep working! 👍😇",5
"I've been playing this game for the past 6 years now and this is by far the most iconic and unique Android strategy game ever created by SuperCell.. My only concerns are, can Supercell do something abt the upgrade time for troops spells and buildings etc etc..and it also cost way to much gems for upgrades which is to be honest quite unfair.all and all ill still give this game 5 stars anyday.",5
It's pretty good app I recommend it when you first start you should probably get the Builder pack battles are pretty good but Ithink it can be annoying when your troops don't go in the right area but don't quit just because things take forever to upgrade because its more of a game u let run in the background,5
"Please fix this.... The miners have no hpbar/indicator, I've been struggling a lot, on attacking especially on town hall 10,coz I'm good at it(and probably other players too) please fox this bug, it's ruining mine and other people's attack, I'm hoping for a response, that's all! HAPPY CLASHING!",5
"So far, so good. Clash of clans is a really good game. I enjoy playing the game. The only issue I have with this game is the time it takes to fully upgrade a building. It's too long. Please reduce the upgrade time. I can't be upgrading just one building for 7 days. That's not nice. I'll take one star from my previous review. Please, work on it. Thank you",4
Solid pick up and play experience. Would prefer lower wait times in crafting but you get enough gems to rush some buildings. Don't feel overly inclined to spend money other than because of my impatience and wanting to make a grand base asap. Solid mobile game to play when you have time to kill.,4
"After a long time I've back to play the game and i found that players are not able to chat globally anymore. It’s really a matter of disappointing. It was fun for us to meet new people and to find clanmates from there. I don't know why you guys have closed this amazing feature. But, you should think once again about this. Hope we will get back the feature. #open_global_chat_again",2
"Idk what happened since yesterday. But it game screen it's showing wifi icon and i am not able to play well. I checked my network speed but it's fine. I think it's a server problem, if it is then plz fix it as soon as possible. Thank u.",4
I really like this game though it have so many updates and changes. Maybe add something like some more views to look at the scenery of the game like you can go like move the screen all the way to your clan mates base and you can view out it so you can see all your clan mates base and your base for looking like a cool thing feature to add this,5
Personally I found this game very exciting and it's more of a pay to win I guess.. for those who are trying to trophy push to higher leagues shield management is important so thereby you've to spend gems.. for me I kinda have to give my base for an attack since I don't have any gems to spare.. but other than that this game is very interesting to play.,5
"It's a good game and it's quite balanced. I haven't seen any bugs, but the only thing I have a problem with is the fact someone who is two town hall levels higher than you can attack your village. It just makes it unfair but asides from that I highly recommend.",4
"Hlo super cell . My brother likes the game soo much . He is playing from 3½ years. Now he is th 11 . Now he feeling difficult to play this game . The game crashes sometimes. Sometimes black screen appears . Please solve the problem super cell . We can't loose this game . We have belief on you . This is the best strategical game for us . If my brother plays this game, I see from beside and enjoy . By seeing only I am enjoying, then by playing how much can I enjoy. I hope super cell ca n fix it",4
Ive been playing for a while and its a very unique game it's interesting and all but could you guys maybe add a few more game modes like for instance you can battle your clan mates in a one Vs one but then you add a twist like for example you can battle for the title of clan leader that would be awesome with a unique map to battle on Other then that it's a very good game 10/10,5
One of the best games I have ever played consistant on updates and really good graphics. There are cool events here and there and game is something that wont be completed in a couple of months it takes years to complete.,5
"It is a good game, but there are many problems of it, firstly it ruqiures too many update, it just irritative, Secondly it it pressurized my phone very highly. When i play higher game yhan coc, like free fire, my phones condition will good, but whenever i play coc, it slow down my phone. I want to say to the supercell that, please do something, This game was too good before, because then the pakage level was low, and we can play this game, easily in lower rams phone,,,,,",1
"I just love this game even if it takes a lot of time to upgrade stuff. Planning and making strategies to attack, it helps your mind function even better. Though it's a little sad when you failed but still you can always improve and learn something new.",5
It's an amazing game but the only downfall is how much things cost and the upgrade timer. You can sit there waiting for 5 days for something to upgrade so basicly you have to spend money.,3
"In March, My COC keep crashing that's why I uninstalled it. But Last week I installed it again because I missed playing it but the bug is there. I tried to uninstall and install it over and over again after that it still there that's why I tried different methods to fix it. But then again I knew my phone wasn't the problem but the game itself. I will change my review if I stop experiencing this issue ever again. COC Dev, please fix this issue since a lot of people have been experiencing this.",2
"I like this bame alot. Features are cool, characters are cool. The currency balance is so great. There are a lot of games, when there are gems involved, your gonna have to use a ton to get ahead, and it gonna be hard to get any to begin with. But clash of clans, gaining gems is reasonable, same woth spending. The match up for battles is fair as well, although some higher leveled players who are like 6 or seven levels above you may attack you sometimes, other than that this is a really good game.",5
"I really liked the new update and enjoyed this game ... I have been playing for 3 years and nothing is wrong ... but after the update ... I opened the clan capital to play, it kept going off as my phone doesn't support this game...but i still try open it for 2-3 times and doesn't work also got me frust...this always happened...but i still love this game and play it",3
"I've been playing this game for a very long time, but one big issue has stood out to me for a while, The cost and amount of time to do things in the higher level town halls is SUPER high. I rushed my way to townhall 12 and have been trying to fix it FOR 2 YEARS yet I'm still not even close. I'm not sure how long I've been playing this game but it is it is probably 6-8 years. This game is fun at low level, But high level needs some love. Sincerely, (long time player) Landon323",4
"Awesome, this game makes me feels victorious because of the battles that I made during the time that I'm playing these also relates to the planning of attacks and upgrading the base inorder to unlock the new weaponry and even new trops and most of time I learned patient to gather gems and buy a worker and it's pretty difficult to earn gems that's why I loved the game to the fact that it is challenging, lastly it improves our capabilities to lay out our base and design our own style of fightings.",5
"Its all perfect but the big problem is everytime i figth in multiplayer battle they give me a opponent a high lvl than me its so hard to get more trophy if the opponent is 2lvl above than me, i cant get a star. Please fix that and thank you for the new update!",3
"While some new changes make sense, the update made the game essentially pointless. Resources are now only required for upgrading and researching, because troops are now free. This is a terrible move for the game, because they killed off one of the main points of the game. I have a strong feeling that this ""highly requested"" change was taken after asking some celebrity players while disregarding opinions of usual players. What are the latter supposed to do now?",1
"This game is good. But when the clan games starts, everything just gets unsettled. In multiplayer attacks, it takes very long time to search and gives tough bases for really low, like 2-5 trophys.Many times i faced, after deploying some of my army in a attack, it can't be deployed anymore. Half of the troops still left but no buttone is working except surrender. Thus, this cause a defeat. This is so irritating. Why it have to messed up during clan games?? Please fix this issues to make us Enjoy.",1
"I got the star bonus and somehow it exited before could collect it so it all went in my treasury which is full so basically I lost out on loads of money which took me ages. They should say 'are you sure?' whenever you select something cause this sort of thing happens all the time. Other than that, it's a good game, despite being obviously designed to be as addictive as possible and to make you click on the game regularly and get you hooked.",3
"I lost my account few months ago and I have been trying to contact the support ever since to recover my account. But they are THE WORST... I want to give this game a five star but the support team is so arrogant, I don't think I will be able to play this game ever again.",1
"Game is addictive, but if your account is locked, which happened to me while changing to my new phone, their team will not even consider your request for unlocking it. Hate you, hated you all you block my one account, i stopp using all accounts right away. hated you.",1
I am having issue to load the game I have tried everything that could be done but I can't load this game in my phone. And it's also not capable of use my other supercell I'd. Please solve this issue cwl is running and I have issues before now again it's happened.,4
"Love the new feature about zero costs of training in home village, Suggestion:if you want to raid in home village you will be paired up with the same town hall lvl,cause I'm at th6 and always getting th8 and above enemy's so this would be helpful Edit:pls make all of the jungle theme skin for the heroes unlockable trough gems cause it really suits the th14 theme",4
I like the Details of the Game and I like fighting in the Clan leagues but the only issue is when you get higher the time takes more and more only if you spend money in the game. Another issue for me is when I try to login to Coc it Kicks me out and if I did it again does the same thing. Sometimes if I get in the game and when I fight it kicks me out,4
Well overall game experience is great . Just one request to the admins do something with wall upgrade prices I've maxed my th about a month ago but still working to max the walls and still it will take about another month this more than crazy enough to ruin the mood just to play for 2 months over walls and single wall upgrade is 100k how does it even makes sense the most expensive building is of about 1100k 11 walls = eagle artillery I hope something will be done regarding the matter 👍,5
"Updating my previous 1 star... To another 1 star. Still play the game, still hate the devs. Builder base sucks, only play it bc I have to. ""Only play bc I have to"" pretty much sums up the only reason to keep opening the app. Don't have an addictive personality with this game",1
Everything is excellent but upgrading the build take too much time. It well be better to take short for upgrading.,5
Best strategic game no need of many changes and especially you do not have to grind for hrs sitting in game and the the game graphic and controls are good and just need to bring changes in the purchase section thanku...,5
"A very Amazing game, I Have been playing this for years now but, I would like to prefer adding a giving resources button or something so you can help out your friends.",5
"Clash of clans is one of the most interesting and popular games in the world. So in this game, when we started really hard than finished. For me, TH 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 are very interesting. I really liked this game. Thank you. Creators",5
"An absolute CLASSIC... A True OG of the ""Android era"" games. I can actually remember when this game was first released 10 YEARS AGO and it's STILL undeniably and inarguably atop the list of games that are most impactful and still relevant after a DECADE!!",5
"Hey CoC why are you removing things from the game, like the chat and now the national flag decorations. You put some good things into the game, but don't take anything away from it. In fact, add Estonia's flag.",3
"I love this game,too bad I can't log in to my acc now.It has been a while since I played this game and I miss it now.I tried logging in but the code that was supposed to be sent to me won't send.I've been waiting for a couple of mins and there's still no code sent :<",4
"the reduction in trophy is severe when raided especially when in a higher league. It is too much for weak bases I mean, we were trying so hard to earn a star to a stronger bases for 10 to 15 trophies but others will take 40 or above trophies in just 1 raid on us?",1
I really enjoying to play this game...nice graphics....nice character....also playing softly....but I give you 3 star because now a days i saw a problem...when I open this app sometimes app automatically stop or crash and also show me black screen... developers please solve this out....thank you,2
"Everything is great, I'm playing CoC almost 7 years but also i quit coc 4 times, i gonna tell what i hate about this game. The Trophy system is awful i lose more trophies than gaining them.",3
"Playing this game, love it. But, the upgrading time is very long.. please shorten the upgrading time duration would be great.",3
This is probably the best game I have ever played. I can also give this game 5 stars but in the season games they should add something good for f2p players except book of heroes.else I love this game.......and had a great experience with it.....,4
It keeps crashing when I try to log in it's a great game tho but I'm taking a star sway until yall fix the crash problem ik yall get many complaints about this but fix it / it would mean a lot to the community,4
"the game is really fun, statisfying and you just have to visit your base for about 3-8 mins. The biggest issue here for me i think is that the clan war league its just toxic queing with way above our League it felt like the game is a bully.",4
If the power potion duration time extends to 1 DAY or MORE then it'll be very helpful because after 2 attack the power poison duration time overs(1hr) which is a very small amount of time while the army production takes 2 hr 30 minutes!!!!(or much more time) PLEASE WORK ON IT POSITIVELY,3
I love this game it helped me to develop strategy and organisation skills. I have lot's of fun as I have joined a clan with my friends. I really suggest this game for every one.,5
Can u plz add a Method/system through which we can select the same attacking members for next war... ..🙏👉As a leader to select the right members for every war become a tough and boring or even... stressfull. task.... So plz think on this and add this feature.....👈🙏,4
HEY DEVELOPERS! LISTEN TO ME... I AM SMART...Give us the option to choose between Two Armies instead of the way it is now... That way we could have an army just for donations & an army for multi/war/ etc etc... Players would LOVE this idea... Trust me,4
"Hey SUPERCELL, Pls fix this. I am losing so much trophies because of this. The players who are attacking me is in higher townhall levels. This is because im in a high rank. Pls fix THIS!",3
"It is nice game for entertainment. This game have no fault and there was no ads in this game which is very good. I have my town hall 13 I'd I reach on town hall 13 in 2 years and my I'd is new on th 13 there are so many interesting events in it which entertain us. Like clan games,season challanges,cwl etc",5
"They should add rewards when leveling up, since that game is useless. It would be very interesting to add that function.",4
"This is a very good and fun game. Only down side is the wait time for when you build something because it can take hours. But apart from that, it amazing",5
"i have a doubt of this game about bad notification system it doesn't show us and not even warning us when anniversary event end or other challenges expired date. We can't claim our rewards at time, because we don't know when date expired.",1
Simply put coc is one of the awsome game i ever played but after this year i say its is the worse the only thing is they suck when it come to recovering the locked accounts its been 9 month but they dont think im the owner even though i provided all information . And yet they just sucks .also theres many account getting locked and many people quitting the the game since they cant recover it after it got locked supercell should do something about or they will end up closing the coc game in years,1
This game is designed for you to fail most of the time. Win some and then fail more to try to get you to spend more to upgrade. It is an extremely slow process if you don't.,1
"Very Good Game, but very long as upgrades take an extremely long time.Quite Frustrating, other than that it is a Brilliant Game.",4
"Everything is fine , just give us option to switch between 1 and 2 rows in Android also because iPad players have adVantage of two rows and we Android players don't have option to switch between 2 rows and 1 rows . This is unfair ❤️",1
Has been a good game since I began on coc though I had lost my account 4 years ago but the helpline was extremely helpful and got it back so started playing again. Whether your new or been on the game before they keep adding new stuff so can keep it feeling refreshing,4
This is one of the best RPG games I played it's time consuming and a lot of fun for adults and kids and it's just really fun to play but it takes you a good minute to upgrade to levels,5
"Been playing for years and there's always something new, new updates and things to keep it interesting. Game a lot and this is without a doubt my favorite game. Recommend it to all.",5
I dont know what to say man other than the fact it crashes multiple times and half the time wont even go past the loading screen until it crashes,1
"It a wonderful and brilliant game...❤️, but from few days me and my friends are facing some problem, problem is our game is not opening and that's not good...I don't know why it's happening",5
"Great game, very fun but be warned of addiction. It's kind of a slogan game and you have to come back to it a lot of time.",5
I've been playing this game for along time now and this is one of the best most interactive & fun game I've played so far & it kinda developed a special place in my mind..So for the developers of this game I would like to say thanks..and I rated 5 stars because it deserved it,5
"Playing it since last 5 months and i must say it can be a little addictive, all i keep thinking about is my village, and new different strategies.",5
Please add more statues..and in townhall.like in the builder base...archer queen statue in builder base .but in townhall no archer queen statue..add add more statue.back the build statue and more too..by the way this is my best and favourite game since 2015.. please add for our game..and PLEASE MAKE THE PARTY SCENERY DARK/ OR NIGHT MODE,3

"This game is amazing, no joke. But just a suggestion, maybe the devs could add more clan ranks such as: member, advisor, senior, elder, co-leader, and leader. Other than this, the game is awesome",4
Playing this game for 6 years .The Best Strategy Game in Play Store right now. It really taught us the real meaning of patience. If you have it you can last long in this game. Really loved the game.,5
All good and fun but the upgrade timers are super long ever since you get to Town Hall 9 so please lower down the timers and maybe some people will come back to the game,4
"I have given 3 stars because in my phone it didn't start as well as when it starts ,it closes and please fix the bug .I noticed that this problem was only with mi phones .",3
It used to be good. Now anything you type in the clan chatbox are being filtered with asterisk. Lot of players are complaining. Just almost anything you type on our language in Ph. Apart from the game now being overly complicated.,1
Nice to be backed playing this game again. However this app has no way to retrieve the previous account I used to play before. Hoping they can help me to resolve or retrieve it. Thank you.,5
This is a very nice game but i request to supercell please add updates quickly you have to give us two updates in a year but you can't doing this please supercell if you are see this so please take a quick action on this and this was the problem but i was love this game very much I advice to all persons please download this game if you start playing this game you cant stop playing this,5

"I really love this game and I'm playing this since 2017 and the only thing that I request is to add a dm or private message, So I can also interact to my friends so that we can to talk to each other privately. Please!>_< thank you! ^_^",5
Fun. Many new mini games. Can be played without any purchases. Purchases just make process faster.,5
"I Started Playing This Game In 2016, It Was Very Fun To Play And The Game Was Very Difficult At That Time, But Now After All The Updates The Game Has Been Destroyed. In 2016-17 It Was Like U Only Get The Loot From The Attacks And Clan Wars But Now It's So Easy To Get The Loot And The Old Nostalgia OF COC Was Just Something Else...",3
Great game! It has stuff you can buy with money but the game isn't that hard without it and no ads amazing game in my opinion play everyday when I'm bored!,5
I love this game so much but when you get th12 the upgrades take so much much time and a lot of loot like gold and elixir and the laboratory take so much time and loot please lower the price and number of days that upgrades taken :(,3
Really this game is amazing 😍. And good fact about this game it's not adactiv and it's have much more things and now i playing like 2 or 1 year around but I can't face any problem. I really love this game,5
"I love but hate one fact, we can't save our progress, every time one gets a new phone. One has to start from scratch again, hate it",1
"Love everything about this game especially the fact that I get to attack for any angle of my enemy Town hall also any formation I want , this game is just a banger👍 for me. So much fun.",4
I like this game so much but there is a small problem. After playing this game alot i get bored so i wish u can do another town hall level15 and new buildings anyway i liked this game so much,5
"the game is not fair with me , i get only 3-19 trophies on every attack , and when someone else attacks me they loot like *i want to abuse so badly* 30+ trophies even 40+ like what the ffff , i hate this game now , supercell you suck",1
It was a good game but now there was an glitch that when I do the attack the black screen was come it make me frustrated when I do attack one more time it happen Please supercell do something,3
Builder hall is bad. Fix the builder base matchmaking because it is so unbalanced and unfair. I often get max builder hall 9 matches and I'm nowhere near builder hall 9. Its unfair and unbalanced. Please fix it because it's pushing me to quit the game entirely.,2
"I like very much this game,but since was upgrade in the last months, the game show very bugs so boring, I regret a lot for this happening, I ask supercell to fix this",3
"I would love an more better view of a hero skin like testing it out in a practice map like the super troops have so i can look how good the skin is rather than buying it and it was actually a bad skin and wasted 1,500 gems.",4
I love the game it's actually my favorite game actuabut I just don't like the interaction with the treasury because the problem is that you can take the you want in the treasury,4
Csnt spend the purple elixir anywhere near fast enough. Also should tell you in the tutorial the green gems are so valuable. I was using then to save 30 seconds when I first started,4
"Alright I changed and yes I enjoyed clash of clans but the problem is why is my loading screen says ""downloading content"" and it won't load even though I did everything to like clear cache and it still won't load.",3
Omg i have been playing coc for pretty long and im in th 10 ! Now when i recently opened my game it said another player online ! When i logged in minor was unlocked and no training time were used ! Also my friends too is it servers play or any other please reply suppercell,3
This is the most epic and most fun game I recommend you the person who is reading this to download it because not only is fun but you can also teamup with players from around the world,5
It is very very worst situation that it is not at all opening the app is not ta all opening if u will not fix the problem i should send a notice to ban the game so please make it login as fast as u could,1
Playing since last 8 years and still have the same excitement level when I started playing this game....Absolutely loved it must try sometime.....!!!!,5
"This game sometimes make me so upset, especially when i reach to a high level town hall than all types of costs become too high that's so rude and if i don't talk about the time than it will be better☠️",3
"The game is great! It's the ""please wait transaction pending"" day after day that bugs me. Someone fix this please!!",2
"Perfection.I love all the strategies and diffrent troops,and when you level up get alot of new things,and I love all the diffrent heroe skins!Like I said,PERFECTION.",5
This game is great i love everything but there's a glitch on chromebook (my device) that start happening a few weeks ago if I open clash of clans it will close right away please fix this,4
My Super cell and email id was same which got hacked . I am unable to login with same I'd. I contacted the support in the game and gave all the correct information still they are not able to find tha account. I evn have my profile screenshot shot. Email the developers still same. No resolution. That Automatic support system sucks. No use of it. It is not hearing my problem. Just giving some options. Even though followed the option nothing happens still same . I lost my game I played for 8 years,1
"Pretty fun game. There is a challenge mode that is interesting but can be frustrating. You basically play the game like normal, but play using the Battle Machine as if it were a useful hero.",4
Worst Customer service I ever seen.I have tried so many times to contact they are not responding.Very Bad Customer Support.if i able to give 0 star i only give that to this game.i have mailed for so many time but not replying.worst app I ever used.,1
"In-game support never listens,and email ones say to contact from in-game support for some problems, they just never help, will change this review if they actually do it right at any point of time",1
Game is good but we have to spend too much time to blowing our armys and when we want to attack enemies that town hall are too hight then us...nd it is chances to defeat.nd when i was push my troops.. in once enemies attack my village it wll m--20.to 30 troops it is very difficult to push troops but easily minase...please make some good in next update🙄🙄🙄,3
"I really like this game very fun👍 been playing it since 2016. unistalled it a while back because of new phone,and now that I reinstaaled it whenever I try to open game my screen goes black and also even if it opens whenever I have to go on a different page like the clan war page or to attack someone or just to edit my base and it is really irritating and after reading other comment seems many people are having same problem so ,I request pls fix it and make the game perfect😀.",4
"Very satisfied, good game as well as the graphics, but I'm very confused because when I'm going to battle there is problem which is a lag portion. Sometimes this game didn't work even when I'm logging in. PLEASE FIXED IT❤️",5
"it's fun and all, but it's too easy to spend heaps of wasted time on the app. designed to get addictive - in my opinion",3
I don't know why but from this recent update came from supercell has been horrible for me. Whenever i play the builder hall it automatically came out of the game. I have found no solution about it. Before i liked this game a lot i don't know why this is happening. Pls response supercell help me pls.,1
"Great game, the only thing I would change, or add is a feature where you can see what the max level for a building is for your town hall level.",4
"Everything is great but, whenever I tried to attack in clan capital the stops automatically and I would have been lost my attack. It happens again and again. How can I fix this problem??",4
Good game recommend it is a bit violence against other people's work on their village 7and over should play it does take time to build your own village and building's for the village can be very annoying waiting for whatever you are trying to build there are in game purchases for gems that can help you speed up what your buildings,4
"Just played recently and i was about to attack on war. My troops are ready and when i tap on attack button, I only have my heroes. please do fix some bugs. it's really annoying",3
"Add options:- find base for cion, trophy,elix or ,darkelik. And this option help to find base with most resources or trophy.becuse while search only show resources but player need trophy and vice versa.",3
My app isn't opening while using my data connection. I have jio sim. When I am connected to a network through wi fi then the app is opening without any problem.,1
"I hope to solve the clan match issue. When a player is kicked out, he can't continue with other clan points, the points remain in the old clan and the player doesn't win prizes. The leader can kick all the bosses after the clan match ends and only the leader wins the rewards.",1
Great game that deals with strategies and tactical attacks and defense. It's a nice game that requires patience and good strategic thinking. If your looking fo a game this is the one you need.,5
"Tactical, strategy, war and so much fun in competitive matches.... Please add a zombie weekend. Team up with ramdom clans... Sort of like clan royal. Friendly units can place two defenses on each other 1 for starters. The longest lasting will be Victor. With such amazing scripts you all shall be able to create it. Unless you have became lazy slobs. It's a challenge. Make tiktoks about it this will make your sales sky rocket. Gift player's who have been absent since you started like me. Loyalppl",5
This is an amazing game supercell always has the best mobile games I've been playing this game since launch its good there's a lot if troops you can choose and a season pass only problem upgrades take days if you're high level,5
"This is a really nice game, The strategies, the tactics and all make this game a real real hard to compete and you have to build you town hall to make your army and base strong for attacks.",5
"I'm started playing this since 2016, quit for a few months then play again then quit then back to play. Now I redownloaded it back and love a new updates especially the zero training cost!!!!!",5
Game ruined by anti-social stalker. It's cute that for once in my life I find decide to spend my hard earned money on pointless mobile game only to turn around and get stalked by some antisocial weirdo cuz I like them outta clan. my gaming experience has been ruined complained to supercell and they do nothing of course so I'm done you guys just lost a Money Train,1
I love this game of all I have played. But I just needed a feature for waitlist which will automaticly upgrade the next upgrade as the player choose (atleast one or two upgrades in line),5
"I've been playing for 8 years and if i want a feature, it would be the heroes having a first person view when attacking someone after every troop and spell has been deployed",4
"I'd like to point out 3 things gems are basically impossible to get for starters and not to mention it takes 5 hours for my army to be deployed only to be destroyed in 2 seconds plus my village being raided by six people in a different country overnight and losing half my progress make a mode where, you can't attack people and they can't attack you this would be a 5 star easily if it included these features.",3
The game is absolutely amazing but I am not able to open the game whenever I open the app the screen goes Black and the game shuts down . please work on this problem and solve this,4
I am playing this game since 6 year and one thing that make me boring is army training time and upgrade time it's take more than 10 days that's made me tired that's why I uninstall this game often times reason behind 3 star is only time. fix it we love it our time is very important for us,3
"Best mobile game ever made, im TH 11 i wish things went by quicker not so much time to build things, kuz now im waiting up to 2 week for an upgrade that costed 5 million, i feel like you should be able.to spend some gold or gems to speed it up by a few days.",5
"I hope graphics improvements because when you zoom the game getting low the graphics . The graphics very low , please add enhance the quality graphics of game to make more sense and excellent from now my rate 3 🌟 I'll wait the next update make it the graphics better please fix graphics and I will rate 5 🌟",3
"A fun, unique, free to play game. Supercell does a great job of making the game playable for free, and with no ads. They make lots of new content.",5
Great game! Just don't upgrade the main building until you upgrade every other tower to the max that you can get them to.,5
"Addictive game and by far the best stratagy game going. Shame you have to wait to fight when your clan is building, though i guess that makes it more exciting planing your next move... Keep up the good work",5
"A good game with friends around, when solo can be a bit boring, but realy a good game for short , long solo and accompanied sessions alike, I would very much recommend this game.",4
Keeps crashing. You can't even make a single attack without the game crashing. What is the point.,1
Hey developers there is an issue while launching the coc. It takes a lot of time than usual to open the game and the servers are doing a low performance which is not bearable.,3
I really love playing this game nice balance with game play between battles and strategy only downside is waiting periods for buildings and upgrades but still fun to keep you busy😁😁,4
"I think clash of clans is a great game, definitely sucks you in easy especially if you start ripping through your gems. But if you're more patient and earn gems and maybe occasionally spend money on the game it can be great. I think especially if you work.",4
"Take off the personal break, I used to plan clash of clans in 2014. I'm starting all over again and this expulsion from the game is absurd. I'm deleting this game to play a new one, there are many others without this feature!",1
"My account was connected to my Email address. The problem is, i dont have access to my email anymore. The only access that i have was facebook but repealed by Supercell. Please. I need the account. Thank you!",1
"My battle machine went straight to the center of the village to destroy a crusher. When he finally reached it, he started attacking guard post troops, dying in the process, not even touching the crusher. 10/10 would recommend",5
"Guys please apply old sound of building in game new sound is very bad there is no difference between the sound of walls, defence, and all other buildings and please improve some graphic. But at the end new update is cool 😁😁❤️",5
Played this game for many years. Very balanced. It's not a game where u get bored quick and not a game where it gets to boring cause it takes to long. Just shorten the cost for walls and I'll forgive you Supercell,5
Awesome game! I play it a lot. No big bugs or anything BUT I would like it if it could save on Kindle fire as well. Almost lost my th8 base. Definitely 5 stars. Awesome🙂🙂😃😃😃,5
"Amazing game, can be hard to keep up with the challenges but still overall lots of fun and really enjoy playing this game for over the past 7 years!",5
Best game ever and I never get bored because there is always some way I can improve my base and get better loot.Its also so fun to just crush everybody with dragons and rage.I would recommend this game if you like tower defense but with alot more action.and base building.,5
What the hell is wrong with the game ....it is crashing again and again ...I can't even attack....i lost 3 raid attack because of it..... please fix the bug....,1
"Played this game for many many years, spent 100s of pounds on it And now I can't even play it for more than 5 seconds WITHOUT IT CRASHING I've got a 3 year old phone, shouldn't need a brand new phone to play a kids game Poor updates by supercell Definitely lost lots of players",1
"We Need Wall Shuffle feture, after clicking on wall there should be a one button it will change wall randomly or once level wise. actknowlegde and Implement this UI feture if possible.",5
Fu@& the builder hall side. Its designed to keep you in a certain trophy range in order to entice you AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE to spend money and gem up to the 6th builder. Seriously ive spent way too much on this game and i am fu$*ing done.,1
The only game that doesn't get bad even after many updates . I am playing this game for more than 5 years but I never got bored. Amazing game with free play. We don't want to spend money to play this game. Love it❣️,5
Best game ever made .....!!!!!!!;!!;! I love this game . This game has all cool characters i am giving it five 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🔯🔯🌟🌟🔯🔯🔯 thanks for making this game And i loved it And also please make games like this this game graphics are incredible . If i rate it . I will give it 10/10000000000000000000 fantastic game We can battle with others and much more .i am requesting everyone to rate 5 stars . Please.,5
"Please Reduce the time n training troops and brewing spells by 50% or more to make the game more fun , more battles and also to make old players come back again to the game!!!! Training and brewing time makes the game so boring!!! More battles, more players!!!",1
An amazing game. Have been playing since 2013. They bring new and really creative ideas and events which keeps us hooked to the game,5
I had been playing this game for 3 years but my th 14 account was locked 4 days ago for security reasons.I messaged players support and gave all information.Supercell verified me as real owner.But when I went for log in it looks game account was not found.This is such a frustrating thing for me.I need my account back.I gave 1 star for such low players support services.,1
"This is an excellent game,I am playing this game from past 3 years and it has always been a fun experience playing this game.At the first when I started playing this game I was a very big noob I didn't knew anything I lost every match and now my Townhall level is 13 and I have so much big base that people who called me noobs now want to be in my friend list and visit my base.From this I understood that I have to give time to this game.",5
"Supercell, I think that you can do the game more interesting while adding a bank in coc, the bank will manage the gold, exiler etc. In that you can create something unique bank concept in coc so that the players will give more interest to play the game.I am in th10 when I am doing an upgrade time taken was 4, 5 days so in that period money which i store is completely wastage so you think after it. Your game player. Shankar.",5
Love this game and play it almost every day for years. The biggest problem is you need to switch the timing of CWL and Clan Games. End of season and CWL conflict each other,5
the app always force close when enter the clan townhall especially when attacking or scouting the enemy and also when try to doing the anniversary challenge. Please fix the issue!,3
"Since the update I can't play!!! I try to load in and it kicks me off!!! Fix it!!! Because I'm pretty peeved of, I've put loads of time and effort into my bases",1
"I've been playing for 7 years and it's only gotten better, always kept me occupied and the community is awesome, I never wanna quit! Always putting out amazing updates! 10/10",5
"A lot improvement from few years back I played last time however you need to stop wasting players time, stop forcing me to wait till finish opponent attack while builder base attacks, just WHY? it's annoying nobody even watch it nobody cares just STOP IT let me play and DON'T waste my time by annoying me",3
"This is really a excellent game. I like it... Some grafix should be changed.. And some man's hit point should be high like ballon, archer and barbian..",5
"Probably the best game (in my opinion) its very fun with all the troops, You can make custom troop strategies. Like Laloons or Barch. Very fun strategy game!",4
"You have a bad matchings, I'm town hall 8 and all of my opponents when I attack are either town hall 9 or town hall 10, what's up with that matching, you can't even win, all the trophy I work hard for are now gone because their too strong.",1
I am playing this game for 6 years still i like to play this game and i am enjoying this game. Getting connection error during war and battle please fix this my trophies are gone...😭😭😭,5
"I just noticed that there is a bug in CWL where the displayed number when attacking is not specific for example (Number 20, but my number will be like 21 or so) . And please fix warden invisible life aura.",4
I love the game but I can't buy any thing in the shop that cost real money becuase there alway this bug where it say transaction pending I literally tryng logging ou of my supercell ID and signing in again and I still can't be able to buy gem or other offers for real money,2
My kids asked me to play this with them. Lots of fun! Go at your own pace. Good combo of building and attacking with lots of opportunity for strategizing.,5
Best game I have played in my life. The beauty of the game is that old things still remains in the game and new things comes after update without ruining the old one which makes this popular even after 10 years of relese🤩😍❤️❤️,5
"Been playing for a long while. Its a really long grind tho, like actual years. Btw, if you are gonna spend money on this game gold pass is the most efficient thing to spend it on",5
The game is good except why would y'all do random wars. For instance lvl 2 clan against a lvl 4 clan that's insane. And can y'all lower the time which things upgrade. It takes way to long.,4
Ok this game is really annoying every time I want to revenge I can't cuz the person always has a sheild and there is no way of know when that shield ends and I just lost 52 trophies is there suppose to be a maximum trophy to be taken I might just delete this game,3
I love this game. It doesn't get hi-jacked by advertisements like most other games! Nice job! I go at my own pace. I haven't found anything that I enjoy better! I have CoC on my phone and my tablet. Some people tease me because I'm the only one they know that is still playing it. SO WHAT?????,5
Madarchod game ... When I am attacking on a base then reload game option comes .. this is very wierd thing... Why connnect problem during attacking on multiplayer battle???,4
Game randomly deploys troops or won't deploy them at all sometimes. I've cleaned my screen and none of my other apps have this problem. Becoming unplayable at times,3
The support is terrible!!!!!!! I'd give 0 stars if i could. I can load app becuase it doesn't work with android 13 for some stupid reason. Ugh support can't find my account so they won't talk to me. Francisco J. G. Was the support rep that gave up. If you are hiring for a support rep don't hire this guy.,1
Great fun have been playing for a long long time but I wish I could change the clan name after its been made and I don't want to leave to rename them pleas emake it a feather even if it costs gems I'll be happy to pay,5
I love this game. It has new features. But you need a little bit of patience when you upgrade. I'm addicted to this game when I redownload it. This game is unique than other games that's why I love this game.,5
It's a wonderful game and loved it more. I have played more than 7 years since 2014. There are more updates and it looks like very interesting. Just try it friends.,5
"One of the best games ever after a few hours worth of gameplay it starts to get little repetitive, but overall is a very good game especially for mobile",4
Love the game always spend time on it but you guys keep upgrading the game each time like some times when I enter the game it shows me to go upgrade it love the game though,4
I just wanted to recover my account but they ban my account. It's just a supercell id problem that i didn't receive any code so that i try to message them to recover my account. Then i try to message them for banning my account then they just end conversion without hearing me out.,1
"Tedious, repetitive and boring. Attacks will never see 100% unless you are deliberately attempting to be in the E Leagues. Also, no one but Content Creators and Pros ever log in anymore. 95% of all Clans are dead or are extremely toxic. Don't waste your time or your money here.",1
"Fun, the battles are fun. The collecting is fun. But the long time you wait for upgrading is boring.",5
"Great game, little down time. Most base builder games consist of waiting for timers to run down and you spend very little time playing. Clash of Clans lets you actively play while waiting.",4
Idk if it's a bug or anything but who ever attacking me r getting more trophies even if they r th 11.......pls go through this i am very angry....i m trying to push but i am losing trophies at a very high rate like 37 trophies is too muchh😡😡😡😢😢😢,1
Very addictive game. Played it overnight.. The only but is i gat banned for trying to recover my old account because i didn't fill in the form accurately . i probably forgot some informations...😤,5
This is a great and original game tho you have to have a lot of free time and you have to make sure you keep checking on it. There are in game purchases but they aren't necessary.,5
Cool game. But we had are flags taken away from us. So do you think you can give us unlimited boulders that we can turn into statues. Or turn in to outer walls with people walking around on them.,4
"The game is very interesting and doesn't take much data and battery I think you need to change the way builder upgrade things e.g.,using hammer to hit elixir storage,using hammer to cut trees That's my only concern",5
Great game as long as you're active. Loot isn't too hard to come by if you do attacks daily. Literally helped me get my life together with routines involving playing it .Thanks supercell,5
Amazing game but please reduce some upgrade times because new players want to max base fast and they have dream to push legend league . So upgrade take lot of time please reduce time .,5
"I'll give it a 2 out of 5 because whenever i attack and i won the attack and when the internet turns off and when i turn it on again i lost, please kindly fix that bug",2
"Too many bugs in their updates, game is crashing but you can't blame my phone, it's doing on a Samsung not 20 ultra and a brand new Motorola that has no issues with any other apps on either device",1
Realy its a great game. I am playing since 1 months i loved this game. I play clash of clan with my friends. I am playing still now i am at townhall 10. I get exited when i get new troops and i definatly recomended this game its my honest review for this game but when you play this game you have to put patient in this game. it is hard to bit when you start playing it become so exciting.,5
"I have a suggestion for traps. Why when I upgrade the trap from level to the next level, I wait for a long time? I hope you make the traps like a wall without waiting time, thanks",4
"Why does it always shows network error even when I am using wifi, I really disappoint me when error shows in the middle of the match. Please fix this error....",2
"My shield ran out im level 3 i was attacked by 4 level 55 players in less than a minute then attacked by 2 level 52 players wiped me out,,,, thanks if your going to play then spend your money ,, or dont play and throw your money out the windo",3
A good game and theres so much to do now that theres 14 town halls. The only problem is that when you get to the higher town halls upgrades take ages... like day,4
Its ok graphics impressive game tho Every 20 minutes It seems like it crashes and my pc once broke because it overheated.So please fix it I wasted like 600$ On a pc that broke from over heating.,2
"I'd say its a good game, definely made part of my childhood. Setting my nostalgic values aside, this game is a well balanced and fun strategy game.",4
"After the new update every time I attack some easy TH the game disconnect from the server, it's fine as long as I am attacking something that I have no chance of beating but the moment I put my trops on a easy base it disconnect. I don't wanna look like a cry baby but still this really s**ks",5
"Totally waste app 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 First of all, clear the bugs When I opened the app it loads upto full but not loads remaining some and the screen goes black So, please remove these bugs and improve without lags(hanging)",1
I played this game constantly for over 3 yrs but recently nearly every game I played my opponents had twice the elixir I had and I couldn't win no matter what cards I played. TOTAL F@#KING PILE OF SIHT.,1
Taking lot of time to search for opponents....Is it because of shortage of oppeonts or is this your new glitch??...It's really ruining my game play...fix this!!..Btw i have stable network connection.,1
"Security on this game to weak! My account hacked yesterday if im try to recover im support chat he said im not real owner, im create account from 2015 and gone like that cause supercell id to weak have original email from account still cant login and my account can move to another supercell account from stranger people!!!",1
This game is played by a lot of people throughout the globe. And after my8 years of play legend league which we all work towards is the most rigged auto generated game you'll ever experience do not get involved.,1
I love this game it is very fun and addictive I just dont like how the characters go wherever they want after you place them I think you should be able to tell them where to go even after you spawn them,4
Would have given a 5 star but losing connection over good wifi when just starting an attack on a base and then have to replenish your troops and you don't know if you won or lost.... is a bit of a mood killer,3
Everything is fine in this game except the part that i personally couldn't keep up with the consecutive updates that i started to give up the game... But every thing else is pretty good👍👍,4
Time waiting for buildings to be upgraded is ridiculously long! The versus battle match-matching is rubbish.,3
"I gave this game 3 star because When i going to attack i can start attack suddenly game was back and i loss the attack this was happening last 4 5 days i am very disappointed from this humble request to you for solving the problem,bug",3
It's a fun game to play as well as a strategic game... You sometimes loose but that dosent mean that you won't play the game... If you are playing you might loose or you might win.... Anyway it's a n awesome game...,5
Good game this game can build village can travel from other land and theyr have multiplayer and single player and you can train some troops and you can upgrade some troops to.,5
"This game we play for 14 years at last the support very bad that we need change email they deny that, I will stop play with any of this company The game funy but the support very bad and don't have experience,",1
"Good game for making stratagies and how to defend when someone attack you and. Also, this game teach us the beautiful meaning of patience. Have patience to win the game and to make a record player..",5
"Slow game, you can tell the only people who play this game anymore are the people who have been playing more than 3 years, wich is why this game (for me) isn't fun anymore because there's nobody new, just new accounts.",1
"For me this is a nice game, this game is a stress reliever and all the players are friendly so I'm going to give it a 5 star. Hope there are more upcoming updates. I also want the global chat to return :)",5
"matchmaking for versus battle is the worst, keep getting a higher town profile, i couldn't even win, in 8 matches i only got 1 pity enemy which was stupid, my trophies went down to -200 from that alone",1
"Would give 0 stars if I could. Game will never load, when it does load its super glitchy and kicked me. I have enough space and everything.",5
"I liked no loved this game best game ever made. Only this game is the best game in my opinion. In spells Lighting spell is the best. You should play this game. I should say that this game should be the first game in strategy but there,s a problem we can,t play it with friend well we can chat with them and challenge them but we can,t play with them as teammates",5
There is not security and privacy in Game An Hacker Hacked My 3 Gaming Ids Without Any Personnel Information. two times my Account Got phished by the same Hacker. when i try to contact from In Game Help and support the lost account form is not submited even i tried to contact from google forum but they told me to Contact from in game support l. im playing this Game Since 2016 l. worst Help and Support !!!!,1
"Regarding for the clan capital, please put a notification on who were editing the lay out of bases since some of co leaders just threw the defenses infront of attack area and we can't know whos doing it. looking forward to improve it, it really important for the clan",5
This is a great game for the whole family me and my Three sons play this game together and it passes the time pretty good the only things is it's really hard to get Jim's and it doesn't help you I know with what you need to do,5
It's a good game. But yeah sometimes it forces me to disconnect in the middle of attacking something albeit a war or just randoms.,4
Nothing much its a really great game about 7 years of experience really great one only need to give some tips to my fellow friends Dont Rush do everything nice do everything perfectly slowdown speed upgrade everything 😁,5
"So far the game is good and better, after an updates, but hopefully you will make self challenge, like challenging your own base.. I'll give my last star if it happens.",4
"fix this game please! everytime i attack at home village i always got disconnect! And it said ""Connection Lost"" even though my wifi is not really slow. Fix it please!!",2
"The new update will not work on my phone. When I loaded the game it said there is an update. It will not let me play without the update. So I went to the play store to update it. I used 91MB of my data and ""updated"" it, however it didn't do anything. It still said I needed to update and wouldn't let me load the game until I updated. So I tried again, and used another 91MB of my data but it still didn't work. My device has sufficient memory so that is not the problem.",1
It is disgusting game.My village always got attacked and reduce more than 20-50 trophies.When I try to attack to opponent then I always got max base and higher townhall and maximum 3-5 trophies when I completely attack 3 star.Plz fix this problem😠,1
"Honestly, Great game Supercell Y'all did an amazing job on this game, I've been here since around 2010 or so. The graphics are good, challenging tactics, and a super duper slept on story. Overall to leave it short and sweet, pick this game up if you're looking for a game that you don't want to be a chore, fun, brain-challenging, but simple.",5
"This new update is having issues, a whole lot of issues, black part on my screens in my base, in clan capital and when I attack, constant crashing, alot of bugs. I'm in Legends league and it logs me out when I'm attacking, I'm losing trophies and it's annoying, please please and please do something about it.",1
I love the game like actually love it but as a kid data is hard to come by for free so I would like Super cell to make clash of clans have an offline mode where you can just upgrade stuff and train troops,4
I don't know why it's stop working in my mobile suddenly it's stop working and it's been 4 days. I updated this but no use it can't be open very bad experience I face 😏,2
"The upgrade times are ridiculously long. I mean come on. Why do they have to be so long? I don't understand the concept here. Game would be better if we didn't have to wait days and days for upgrades to finish. I love the game but the upgrade times are keeping it from getting 5 stars. I, along with others would like to see the upgrade times lowered. Hours, fine. Days, unnecessary.",3
Builder base ais are really dumb. Certain bases I out my giants in the path of the crusher and for whatever reason they ignore it take loads of damage and attack one-off the other defenses next to it wiping my army out because they refused to target the correct thing this needs fixing.,1
"I had played this game about 1 year ago and took a break, at the time my town hall was level 4 and I just got back into it, this game brings back so many memories.",5
"Supercell's biggest hit delivers with Clash of Clans, although time consuming during late game, with patience and game knowledge it is still playable without spending a dime.",5
"i don't know if any developer will see this review , but if someone do see this i have a request, that can you please show that old icons of all troops like old wizard old giant troop icon that was very nostalgic i or i say coc community really want to see that old weed golbin again in coc please! please! please! thats my only reqest ...",3
Fun and challenging especially designing your setup on how you want it to look just love the challenges of the game and game play,5
"The game is good, enjoyable and interesting. But can you please bring the Global Chat cause it is hard to recruit active and loyal clanmates.",5
I open the app it says good news! A new version is available. But upon clicking the update button and going to playstore it doesn't have an update button for updating only uninstall and play. I can't open and play the game! It is not good but a bad news,5
"i just replayed this coc game, but there is something that makes me and my friends uncomfortable, namely a bug that causes our cellphones to heat up, and I see the cpu running up to 99% wow, please fix this!",2
"I love this game, at first it's very addictive. Once you get into a year it starts to get less and less addictive it takes longer time to upgrade stuff and there no point in attacking other players.",5
The game is so good..thatis why is really painful when is not recover please help me to recover my clash of clash..it had been long time to play with this game..7 years ago when i try to play with this game ang i find peace and happy environment. During my time with this game i experienced many trouble and failure but at the end of the day i find happiness ang recognition with my self..i found friendship ang camarediry and collaborative actions among my clanmates to achieve our goal to win.,5
"app has issue with network connection coc team need to fix this ""connection error - fail to connect server"" due to this i had worse experence while playing,and loss multiple matches",1
This game is good you have to have a strategy to win just that every once and a while you get attacked and have to get more coins and juice to make your team and that takes a while for it to fill,4
Wow the new abdate is really good that we can train troops for free but the reason I am giving it four star is I recommend that they should reduce the building and upgrading time I am saying this because many people in my society have deteted the game because of the time so people get bored while the days process for upgrading is going on so pls guys reduce the time,4
"Interesting strategy game it's challenging on each troop as it's own targeting system like suicide bombers like to target walls only, but if you can learn how it works and plan out your strategies one can be very successful in playing this game.",4
"Very nyc game..., used to be..but after the recent update it stopped working properly. Screen is going black.., every time i change between any kind of village or transition, can't even play..since 99% of times it does not start properly, really annoying, and sometimes idk why after trying many many times id starts ..Please.... Do something about it fast!...... Like soon please... Or else just close it... Save ours and yours.. Everyone's time!",1
Down to one star because basically you make it to her you cannot win it's ridiculous I'm going to uninstall the game. God you dame people if you would just play your own game once maybe you would understand you got to make it to where you can at least have a chance. know matter what combination you use you still can't win I'm talking about the second added on part I understand that I'm not that good at the game but give us a chance,1
"The game has new upgrades since I came back, but the problem is it lags and glitches a lot now, so can you fix the problem",2
It's a cool game I am still playing this game but I had a complaint that there is no fixed star system like sometime I get 2 stars on 50 persent and some time I get 1 star on 99 persent so I request to fix the problem and there should be a fix star system.once again I liked it much and suggest that download it.Sorry The star system is already Fixed I noticed it now.,5
Best game ever but I give 4 stars because there is a problem I'm a clan leader and my clan is in level 9 and I want to change my clan name but there is no option to change it so please kindly solve this problem,4
"its awsome 😍 I love the P.E.K.K.A.S and dragons. but you should add more troops and heros or a custome hero but its cool 😎 and that once in a while that hero skins are free. cuz not everyone can pay. you wuld get more ratings. Update: when getting the town hall at a higher level, it starts getting ridiculous the time it takes to upgrade stuff, A week at most, Its ridiculous man, come on it's still a good game but wuld be better if you know. changed that.",4
"Hello my account is locked and asking for code. Can somebody help me, i have purchase receipt, email and other things, in-game help is saying we cannot help this time, and there are no other helpline i found, please help me it was hard to reach Town Hall 14.",1
"I am rating just four star because this game is good and has good graphics but if you lost connection while attacking you have log in again and you cannot enter the battle again and the only troop you deployed will attack the village and you wins or lose the battle by not supporting your troops.Supercell should fix this problem because it feels bad if you lose the battle and your trophies falls down and cannot gain the loot in the battle, Otherwise this game is too good.",4
"Most of the time I attack a base, my game dies of internet, even if my game can perfectly restart after my game dies, and when the internet is working perfectly fine",1
"This game is good . I think none of the game will run like this for years . But there are some issues with this app . The screen suddenly becomes black while opening the game and sometimes doesnot open in somedevices . Please include heroes in war even if they are in upgrade ( you get it ?) . If we upgrade heroes , we dont need it in normal attacks let it upgrade but we badly need heroes in war..... so please bring a new update for heroes in war ...please i req you for this. I hope you will do .",4
This game deserves 5 STAR but only thing I req you to plz add audio chat system in this game...This can help us to chat freely with friends...Because we get tired of writing huge lines...So kindly give attention to my words and consider in it.🙏🙏☺️,5
Have played for years. Was enjoying the game. Was spending money. Then one 3.99 purchase was not delivered. I wrote in expecting it would be resolved but they flat out refused to make it right. Very annoyed to not be able to trust them with my money anymore. Not sure I will like playing when I feel I cannot safely purchase. Incredibly disappointed.,1
Solid. Didnt try for so long but woulda had fun playin before. Just get into it. Watch out for being spammed to spend your gems but still good and free if you want it to be,5
"To be honest my phone is weak in other games it causes crashes but this app is not logging a bit, the only that that i personaly a bit annoyed is whenever the network is weak cause me to restart the game but good news the process of the game was restored after it has disturbed.hehenice👍👍👍",5
"My daughter asked me to try this game. I've never played a rts b4. I'm a role playing, sim building type. It's a steep learning curve. I get frustrated waiting for my builds to complete but I'm addicted. Often I log in and stare at the screen just watching seconds elapse on my builds and upgrades.",4
"This game is very very good.It requires you to have a very good sense of strategy.But the reason I am giving it 3 stars is because when you get to the next town hall it gets almost impossible to have more trophies,the trophy winning system is just wrong.",3
"I've been playing this game since I was in 5th grade, love the gameplay and being able to form clans with friends. Also love the clash of clans ads, one of the few ads I don't skip on YouTube",5
"It doesn't feel good if one app gets so many updates. With the update, the space of the phone decreases more, for which it becomes difficult to use other apps. I will see in a few days and then I will uninstall the app. My 11 Max ID.",1
Please fix this bug this game is really good but a little bit bug when I try to connect to supercell account It says that we will send you a verification code but I check my email and there was no code please fix this bug please I am not saying that the game is not good but a little bug please fix it thank you🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,4
It's the funist game ever in my opinion because you can upgrade your stuff battle make clans with your friends and surprisingly for how old it is it doesn't even lag good job on this game,5
"The game is a great game for people who like to grind for stuff. The game however has a bad side, it gets much more difficult to upgrade late game.",4
"Waiting for the townhall upgrade... M th 14 max nd there is nothing left to upgrade, please give us a brand new townhall ...waiting for a long long time.... Thanks for giving us the greatest game of all time ever🙏 and also for ur attention on my req thank u again......peace✌️",5
"Can't really fault it, this game has brought me a lot of fun for many years now, I originally downloaded it on my ipod touch 1st gen back in primary school, im now 18 (2022) and still play it, the game has changed a lot, it's cirtaintly a lot easier to play now but it's still the same game i enjoyed as a kid.",5
"In my opinion I think of Clash of Clans as a great game😀. However I find it annoying that every time I launch the game, I find the game not loading up the scenery, buildings, or even defenses. This occurs on both of my villages and I am a player who spends abit of my money on the game every once awhile. I especially find it annoying when the game puts this dark empty background as the scenery whenever I want to change my sceneries. Please fix this cuz i am getting tired of this bug. 🙏",2
"It would be great if we could choose how much we want to contribute in capital upgrades, instead of contributing as much as possible. Home village upgrades take time, normal. But I am shocked to see builder base upgrades take longer! That is why I did not unlock the builder base, even at town hall 7.",4
when i load up the game its just a black screen and it crashes after a few seconds. can you please fix this for chromebook?,1
Great strategy game you can play with friend and others online! Highly addicting and you won't put the phone down.,5
"It's fun building and raiding, but it's getting frustrating with the BH raids cause I'm always put up against a BH a level or two up. This makes it pretty difficult to get resources, which are needed to level things up. Leveling items up is kinda the game, so...... It's getting easier to pass the app when looking to play a game.",3
One of the best game I have ever played. Played it for several years now. Only annoyance is the fact otto is so hard to get for F2P people although I can see why due to paying players. Overall a friendly game everyone should have.,5
"So i was updated to the Clan Capital update yesterday. After update, i relize that the sound effect was change. From my experience is colecting Dark Elixir. The sound effect is regular Elixir sound effect that just slowed and lower pitch. And i found another bug that if i watch my replay from Builder Base. The theme sound are still played even i press Return Home button. And it all happen until today (even after i updated bug fix version). Please notice this and fix the bug. But the game was fun",2
I love the game but the getting rid of global chats was an extremely bad move. After doing that 68% of the players left the game and finding clans that are active became impossible. I'm nearly a max TH8 and I've never spent a penny but I'm doing really well. The game is still somewhat fun but without global chat there is no communication of any kind. I would not recommend the game to others at this point.,3
"Fairly easy to play, fun and easy to get lost in the game...with the major exception of the ""Builder's Base"" and the ""Battle Machine"". It seems the Battle machine's AI is set to ""depressed suicide"" since it will walk past all weapons shooting it to attack a good mine of spider collector ignoring defense weapons and the Builder's hall. Been an ongoing issue ""Super Cell seems to ignore complaints about (what else do they ignore)",4
"I'm really disappointed with this game especially after updating it today, I'm not able to watch replays of attacks in war! This is really frustrating i may have to delete the game and be honest to others willing to start this game! I'm not recommending this game to anyone unless supercell responds to me and promises to fix this!",4
"Pls add commas to seperate the digits , I spent 3 million gold by mistake thinking it's 300k . Now I'm spending a lot of time to get that gold back for new th level . And I'm f2p so I don't buy gems or packs .",4
"after the maintenance, I can't play the game, it keep on saying no internet connection and try again..i have fast and strong internet connection..please help..",1
Its been 10 years since i played this game I remember the times I've made so much accounts because my phone cant handle to make a google play games because i have too much storage.this game is addicting that even if you didnt play for days months years it'll give you a nostalgic feeling,5
I like it because you can get every few days not worry about falling behind the other player playing. I can get on it when I want and not have to worry about taking too long. And last of all I like that there's two different worlds you then take time to play and build the other one you can play for hours without getting board because you have a infinite Army.,5
I'm playing this game for 8 years...an excellent game I've ever played in my life....I always enjoyed playing this game🥰🥰😍....this game teaches us how to be patient...because such buildings take nearly 2 weeks or more to finish...😁😁💪...and a nice strategy game I've ever seen..waiting for more updates💖✌.. I 100% maxed my town hall 14 and waiting for the th 15 update😁😁🔥,5
"Since the recent update the game has now frozen on me.it says there is a bug in the app.ive tried going through super cell to report the problem but when I go to send the msg with my player ID tag number it keeps on saying, error can not send msg try again later.",1
In my opinion clash of clans is one of the best games I've played in a while you can train troops and then send them out to destroy enemy bases and you can even decorate your own island by putting windmills flowers or flax that's why I think this is one of the best games I've played,5
"Incredible but I wish you could have more than 6 attacks per weekend, when doing raid weekend. Also at th12 it's kinda hard to progress quickly with upgrades lasting 14 days. It takes almost a month to upgrade a cannon twice",5
"I like this game Because, this game not having any bug or problems when I played. They maintaining the game in best way. And one thing I want to request is It is automatically turn off my screen So change the settings.",5
"I love this game in my phone but why isn't it working on my chromebook? It's just crashing when im opening the app and instantly crash, does coc not work on chromebook's?",4
I am a regular player but now I face difficulty in loading and I wish the technical team would take appropriate action and do bug fixes sooner. Waiting for the bug fixes...,1
"Such a worst update this time, everytime game is getting crashed, shall I attack and loose trophies in this manner, very disappointed, never expected such a low grade updation. When you all dont have a strong team then please dont release any new updation, fix your team first then game.",1
"Honestly , the game completely awesome and free to play.but one thing that just annoying is the time taking for laboratory upgrades are really long.Its just literally makes us boring.To dear supercell please reduce time in laboratory upgrades.A perfect 9/10 for this game.clash on ⚡️",4
"The gameplay is great, game quality in graphic is very good. But troops are so stupid they distract easily and scatter round the map. Thay are so stupid to be called even troops...",2
The healer need to revamp. If she fully heal her 1st target then heal another that was her problem please fix that. She keeps healing the troops that fully heal and literally the ones that near her didn't get a chance to be heal that was so annoying to watch.,1
"I've been playing this game for years and not a single problem arised until now. Since the new update, my game keeps freezing up, I know this is not my phone as it never did before. Please fix this and improve my experience with one of the best mobile games of all time",3
I'm addicted to this game since first release but there's something I really want to suggest to the developers. The ability to attack our own base using a customable troops for players like me since not everytime I get to have a clan.,5
"My data connection is very good. I am using facebook youtube easily,,there were no problem...but after this update i have some issue inside game..it seems that i have poor connection..But when I used other app,there are no problems in my net...fix this💔",1
"I played it for a week ago I'm so sorry for changing my review it is very boring when the upgrade is so so so long I am a kind of person that is easy to loose of temper for waiting such us for 18 hours, 1d, 2d I will not pop up some money for this game you should put some option to have gems that will vary to the person that has no interest for spending money you should have some adds to have gemss or other wayss in battle you should include some gemsss to get( include it in loot that we get )",3
best game i have played in a lot of time.. i basically think that the games pay to win but then this clan castle came and helped me a lot with getting loot. those bonus starts are just awesome definitely recommended if you like strategy.,4
"This is probably one of the best and most addictive games I've ever played! I would have given it 5 stars if upgrades didn't take so long and in game currency was so hard to get. Other than that this is an amazing game, would recommend",4
"Literally a waste of time, every update they add some new features like adding more TH level until the upgrade time is 1 month. The heck is that.",1
This is the best game that you'll remember the most.Because the One of exciting feature is to have fun defending your Home Village. The one thing I'm excited the most if they could make a TH 15 and New defenses on the game.,4
I play this game for 7 years it's fun to play.. but now the game always crashes😪😪 and now I'm stuck into down loading content. Pls fix this SC or either wise many players might divert to another game.... Pls fix this ASAP.. THANK YOU. ILL GIVE YOU 1STAR.,1
"Good game I love it but my only problem is when you upgrade the heroes why does it need to require builder nothing will change in there look if the upgrade are finish I mean the only change in heroes upgrade was there strong,HP and ability just wondering if you could change that",5
Its a good game but upgrades take soooo much time dude and not only that the amount of builders are very less so supercell should consider either decreasing the time of upgrades because thats the main problem at higher town hall levels,4
I love the game it's really not for everyone you have to have a lot of patience with the 6 day upgrades at th11 I don't mind the time and the clan capital is awesome and the clans are great you can invite your friends and you can get and give troops also the clan wars and raid weekend's ar great cause the whole clan can contribute the it. Over all I love this game,5
"One of the best game i ever played ❤️ I have more to say but can't explain it by words, u can't be bored, these type of gameplay is can not be seen in any other games. Some are copied from this legend game 😎 but they can't even reach Coc's foot 😒😅 because coc is legend game forever ⚡💥 10 years have been completed and we are celebrating the 10th anniversary. So happy to being an gamer in COC till now 😸❤️",5
As soon as the new Update came out June 26-27 ? My Complete game crashed and I can't even log back in. It just gets me to my base and closes out immediately ? I've been playing this game for 3-4 years now and I have no idea how to get back in...,2
I give only two star because Everytime I was attacking the opponent showing is always highier 1 or 2 level than me and the attacker of mine was also highier. Hope you can fix it.,2
"Overall game is excellent. One problem is that matchmaking in Clan War League is trash. Our clan has 1 th12 as #1 followed by th11s and th10s and the enemy clan has (to be specific) 1 th14, 4 th13, 3 th12 and a couple of th11 during cwl. This is why we can't enjoy cwl as much as anyone do. Please fix matchmaking.",4
Loving the game. Just a couple of weeks of playing it and now I'm addicted to it 24h7. But if you whant to enjoy the game you have to have alot of patience and take your time. Think and chose wisely.,5
"It's the most interesting game I've ever played , I am playing this game for so many years and now I can say that my game is save with my supercell and Facebook ID at first they didn't save my game but now from 3 years it is save, and now there is an update too so I liked it. 🙂",5
This low review is in response to latest update in which there is no cost to train your troop this makes game really boring.. As the troops don't have any worth playing this game for a decade. But because of this gonna uninstall pretty soon because it defeated the purpose of playing,1
The legend game in world. This game is all about construction work. And this is an interesting game. For all ages also we can play. Smooth graphics thats an important feature. And i Don't have any words to say. This game is amazing.,5
I tried contacting supercell to get my old lost account back and not only did they not help me an any way getting it back but they locked my current account and said they can't do anything about it. Supercell support stole my account from me as I was trying to recover an old one. It's ridiculous! Have me talkin to bots.,1
I've been playing Coc in 5 years and i love this game and i love trophy pushing but the my only problem is when im attacking its hard find bases that gives 28+ trophy but when im offline when they attck me i lost 30+ trophies but its ok that's how the game works.,5
"Animation of clouds while searching for enemies is annoying. Makes our eyes dizzy and makes us sleepy. Games are supposed to make us feel energetic and excited, Not bored and sleepy.",1
This is the best defence game i ever played one thing i would recommend is the upgrading is so frustrated you have to wait an hour or maybe a day just to upgrade maybe you could make it a little fast or better you could may enchance the graphics of game,4
"after the recent update, my account crashes after a split second of showing the game after loading. I tried to redownload but it doesn't work. Please help me. You haven't help me with my skin problem now another problem shows up",1
The best game ever.. a lovely piece of art👍 However lately after the clan capital update the game is too laggy and sometimes crashes. Please help fix this issue,2
"I am playing this game since 2017 and can say that it is really fun playing this game. Since 2017, the game has received numerous updates which have made the a game, a masterpiece. Although, there are some features which have been removed from the game game since it was developed but the game still is still addictive and enjoyable.",5
"Great content, lots of events, but there is the grind of waiting so long for something to build or upgrade.",4
This game is very cool and it is a lot of fun to play too our suggestive I would like to reduce the cost of the wall a little so that many new people will be interested in playing and what is of Capital Hall is very good and if you update new skins of Heros for free.,5
My old phone broke so I bought a new phone and tried to login. It says code has been sent to my email id but I never receive any of the codes sent. I have tried multiple times with no success. When I wrote email to support there is only auto generated reply.,1
Love the game! I gotta say the purchases are cheap and affordable unlike other games! This game definatly will keep you playing for a few years! Just keep the game awesome by giving the troops a little more iq please (mostly the queen aka worst wallbreaker ever!) Lol,5
Found my problem. And fixed it. The problem is me unable to play. Reason : I have less than 1 GB memory left in my phone. Fix : Delete things or clear some cache so I have some 1GB or more memory space left. Note. Please fix this. It's irritating. Pls and i like furries especially frog i love frog i hate you MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM NNNMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM i also eat bugs and i love eating worms n ayo i found a bea,1
"MAKING ARMY TRAINING FREE REALLY IS A GOOD MOVE OMG IM SO ADDICTED TO THIS GAME AGAIN, NOW THE BEGINNERS WILL ENJOY ATTACKING NOW WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT UP BETWEEN THE MATHS ON HOW MUCH THE TROOPS WILL COAT AND HOW MUCH LOOT YOU NEED TO FARM. NOW THERE'S NO LIMIT YOU CAN JUST TRAIN AND ENJOY WITHOUT THE COMPLEX MATHEMATICS. Now i can train ny favourite troops without getting annoyed with the cost. Its such an addicting game, and im starting to love using the bowler. I love supercell man.",5
"I've always loved this game..... It seems to always give me something good to look forward too ☺️ I haven't played the added features on the app since 2015 but I'm pretty sure it's just as cool, can't wait to check it out....",4
"Best Game of Strategy and the game of mind but one problem that is it is 70% pay to win game like we can't get gold pass for free even after giving gems,gold,elixer which I don't like and after 5-6 months we can get the skin of hero in 1500 gems butit is very difficult to earn gems cause we only have a way to earn gem for free that is clearing obstacles and they comes very less for active player.So,Please add a faster way to collect gems.Please It is request from all CoC Player. I hope u will.😃",5
Its been a long time since when i started to play this game ... In the old times i was one of the best when th10 was the highest and no star bonus and the 16h of shield will be gone if you attack 1time .. I think its a lot better and so easy to play this game .. I love this game...,5
Now please replace no cost army training and wall upgrading with elixir in TH 08 because it is now become less interesting to play with these new updates that are mentioned above. Thank you.,5
"It is a very fun game with much strategy involved, and it requires time as well, although the game is good, the server are very difficult.",4
Excellent strategic game 👍. Keep it updating. I have 2 accounts 1 account is working properly but when I log in 2nd one the game is getting closed. So please fix it,4
Been playing since the first week this game was created unfortunately I lost my old account and they offered no help getting it back which is why it's gets 4 stars but other than that love the game and will continue to play it for forever!! Lol,4
"TRAIN TROOPS FOR FREE. WOW- PANSY CLASHING! SERIOUSLY?!!! WTFH! I'm disgusted with how large updates YOU FORCE ON US! It used to be barely a 4th of that when you brought the game out. now I'm forced to choose. Clash of Clans or Castle Clash, Final Fantasy & 2 oth! Wonder which is the better choice? I already know! Your game, ""Brawl Stars"" actually killed my NEW Galaxy smartphone!😡😡. I've always been incredibly careful & safe with my devices! NEVER needed a warranty until Supercell",1
"Great game, but the matchmaking in war/war leagues can be very unfair if your clan has alot of lower ranks like th 8/9 & the upgrade time is ridiculous..which can make it kinda boring at times as I often have all 5 builders busy & these constant upgrades dont seem good enough with my clan always going against people much stronger than we are",4
"I've been playing this game since 5years and I've enjoyed it a lot . it's a totally fun game and it's very addictive game. The new feature is amazing, now you can train your troops for free in home Village as well.",5
"Great game , no ads and easy enough to progress without paying . Don't mind buying the occasional gold pass for this reason.",5
It is really amazing game every update come with suitable and balance products.but i always suffer from its updating problem. Everytime when a new update come i have to reinstall it instead of updating it.,5
I have played this game for 1-2 years but i have not got any problem in it but when i opened it today after loading the screen gets black. So i reqest you to fix it faster by 1-2 days please🙏🙏.,2
Best update ever supercell 😍good job 👍 after this update player don't think how to arrange elixir and dark for train your troops. May be supercell wish players are fast update there th for high level. Because high level th os always helpful for better Staretgy build up. I wish all my old friends are back in coc. I miss you my old days when I play coc with my friend. 🥲alright so chief what are you waiting for. Keep grinding and build own strategy for 3 start and Thanks supercell (coc) .. 💗✨,5
"Great game, but I hate that troops are now free! That's so dumb that it's easier to Play the game now, especially since you added many more ways to get alot of resources in a quick amount of time.",1
"Changing my rate because the game feels so lite now. Been using samsung A10 w/ 2gb ram and the games is fast now, not forcing me out of game. And that is the reason I quit playing this game. But now Im back to playing this game and it is really amazing. Been playing since 2015",5
It's great but since the latest update and the game doesn't open. It loads and after the loading screen it crashes emediatly.,4
It's an amazing game. It does not use a lot of data and wifi. Its the best game you can play. It is a exceptional game. It is challenging bit that's the fun part. It's the most fun game to play.The new upgrade is amazing.,5
This game is epic . You need to add a feature to this game allowing you to test your own village defenses. Need some improvements like increase in cost of potions when we sell it. If you purchase book of building it cost you 925 gems but selling cost is only 50 gems.,4
Absolutely enjoy the game play it alot. Need to be able to do a little more with builders base. But really fun.,5
"This game is good and fun but the problem for me is it takes along time to upgrade building,I know there is some majic item to make it fast.I wish in clan castle when you collect resources you can pick what to collect not all of them.",4
"Overall good, but honestly, I think there should be 2 laboratories instead of just 1 so that we can run 2 troop/spell upgrades in parallel Also please consider reducing the housing space of super archer and super bowler",4
Very good game and also interesting game but the game has small problem after the war the train troops will take time to train this problem you can give less time for training this my problem.,4
"Game is crashing after this latest update. Loaded up on a different device to try and recover, but it's crashing there to. Server problem maybe?",1
"The Customer Support in this game is the worst I have experienced in my 50 years of playing video or online games. I have 11 different accounts and 8 of them got blocked when I got a new phone. I am playing 3 accounts on the same phone but yet the lousy support system which is just computerized responses can't verify these accounts are mine. Gave them Clan name, account names th levels and they still say I am trying to steal accounts. By the way I regret having spent over $1000 upgrading bases",1
The game is too good but I couldn't plate cause my supercell I'd is not logging in . I am trying since months but the verification code is not coming . I have checked spam folder and all other folders but the verification code is not received. If you can help me so please help.,1
this is one of the best game i ever played full of strategies offcourse it takes too much time max things but it teach us lesson about be paitence like nowdays no one can wait.but it's been 3 or more years since i've been playing this game but nowdays there is a glitch my screen just goes black and then crash now this is happening more frequent.PLZ FIX THIS,5
When having a maintenance break can you pls stop the countdown on the shield or guard because you cant play while it is in maintenance break and it still counts it is being wasted and if it is already a feature thanks and i love this game,5
"This Game is awesome but it has a lot of problems in my phone and my dads phone it says reload its OK when you are just upgrading but while attaking it has caused me 127trophies and alot of loot in just one acc in dimond almost reached masters I have 5 acc which are th 11,11,9,9and 9 its a problem please solve this my phone is 4GB ram and my father mobile is 6GB ram its not working properly in both acc my internet is not good I know even playing with agood WiFi it works but has some problems",3
Switching down to a 3 star the game was good but now its to drawn out it some times glitches the leader of my clan had his account go blank so now he can not play no more and one more thing is that i just downloaded the new update and now i can not even log into the game fully it says it still needs the update when i go to log into the game it says it still needs it even that i all ready updated it and ive spent money on my account so i better not lose my account over your guys nonsence,4
"The game is fun, I enjoy a lot when I'm playing. The only problem is the update it is only 94 MB but I updated it twice and after I downloaded it, there is another files I need to download.",5
I am loving it been playing sinve 5 years .... discontinued it many times but new updates....all of them are just amazing ..still needs dropping the cost on wall upgrade after TH 11 but I can't complain after new updates,5
"I really love the game but the supercell account system is bad, everytime I log in they ""say"" that they sent a verification code but nothing is sent to me. I can't load my progress anymore. Please fix this",2
"I reduced 1 star now, because the latest update is not good. Means now we don't need elixir to train troops.... Seriously??? What the hell is this. I want and I know maximum of the player does not like it. I hope you will do the previous think, that is we requirements of elixir and dark elixir to train our troops.",4
I want to send Private message to clannmates . I can't Able to convey my message in private.Nice game but upgradation time will spoil mood of the gamer. Builder provided only 5 atleast give 7 builders. Free gems very rarely and very less. I hate this upgradation time so i m uninstall the game.,1
"Game is fun. It's a grind, but stick with it and it's worth it at the end. Other key item is to make sure your part of a good clan. That goes a long way. Still some pay to play, but not as big as it was in the beginning.",3
"I wish that you guys would take away capital clan and bring back global chat so that we can use it to recruit new members for our clans.I would have given u 5 stars but I 1st have to see quicker responses & action taken when you see that we the players have commented anywhere about your game(s).Also decrease the amount of time it takes to upgrade weapons,town halls,troops,spells,seige machines,& training time of troops.Also each barracks should train troops individually to speed up troop trainin",2
"Every update for the last year+ has only made the game less and less playable, which is extremely disappointing considering the amount of money ive spent on this game, just to have it ruined by less than competent devs, who quite frankly deserve to be homeless and broke.",1
This latest update is causing the game to crash on all my devices. I have tried rebooting and removing - reinstalling and it still crashes.,3
"This game is great, there's a lot of activities and fighting and it is definitely a very addictive game, however I've rated it 4 stars because parts of the game is a bit hard but all in all yeah... Great game",4
Troops goes anywhere wheather creat any sort of funnel and game works accordingly. I think one with more winning war streak can clear any base with any useless army ...not at all good ... clear those bugs,1
It's a excellent game but in the new update when I open the builder hall game crashes automatically and i have tried to fix it but it doesn't get fixed so pls fix the bug,2
"This game is fun, family friendly, and a bit challenging and fun at the same time, this game is amazing you call improve your skills when your using Gowipe, lava loon, golem witch, and etc. Very good game. Thats why i gave it 5 stars.",5
In cwl.. If we win.. We get bonus loot.. For every successful attack.. But i didn't got nny.. Even if we(my clan) won all the wars.. Why is that? Can supercell help me with that.!! N i also wish.. If we can train seige machines more than 6 .. It will be very helpful.. Thank u..,2
"This game is awesome, it always entertain me every day, but i rate this 4 star because, for me its kinda hard to earn gems, well cause im a f2p. Building defense is taking long and i need gems to buy more builder hut, so i hope supercell will give more gems to f2p players so that they can buy more builder hut. Pluss! we can buy our favorite skin to our favorite hero. And we miss the global chat that is removed i hope they can make it back soon. Anyway what a great job! on making this game..",4
I've been playing this game since 2013 but now...this update is really not good..i've tried to log in many times and it kicks me out again and again...what happen to this update...fix this immediately plssss..i dont want to lose this game...,2
This is a really fun game i love how you set training to free but theres one big problem see when i was logging in to clash of clans then suddenly my game crashed after logging in many times it still crashes please fix it,4
"not agree with the update You don't need to free army ,spells . It makes game too easy. if you want to do something about this you can reduce the troops rates but free is worst idea.",4
This is a good game to spend your spare time it is not so addicted or any harm like others games just go and attack bases do Upgrade and you have done your day with it. Love very much this game especially the new update you make the troops training free it's very good and thank to you for this love you,5
"The last 5 gold pass hero skins suck!!!!10th anniversary stuff is a joke, clan game rewards was horrible, what I would like to see, the arcade game on fire ( i hate it ) make your own hybrid troops from battle to home village ( for dark, gold, elixir, battle gold, and battle elixir (all) new giant hero with a cannon ( ability shots 3 abjects in a row ) and sell my raid medals for scenery, and hero skin, for 3,000 raid medals, so it should take 10 or so weeks to put into the pool to unlock it.",3
I have seen one review about the clan castle collection of treasure too and it would be great for that to be added so players can collect the certain type of treasure like there should be a button of each resource to collect that certain type of resource in the Clan Castle .,4
The game is great and I played it for more than a year and am still playing it but I wish you make the buildings take less time to upgrade since the army costs no elexir.,4
It's a great game...i am playing it from my childhood till now... But today I didn't get to open the game... An update is made and now it's not opening so please kindly fix it as soon as possible😕🙃 I am giving only 3 star for this incident if it's good I will make it 5 out of 5......remember customer satisfaction is must,3
"Love the game all around been playing for awhile now started a clan and have been doing clan wars daily, this is where the problem is matchmaking in clan war leagues is an absolute joke (a little better in clan wars but still needs work imo) my lowest th is a 4 and everybody (exception of higher th's) got matched with th9s+ (current war). This brings my clan to a severe disadvantage. Like how is a th4 getting matched up with th6+ or th7+",2
I'm currently TH- 10 after playing for 2 1/2 months. so far fun game but seems like it's going to take a long time to level or leveling might need money to speed the process up. Fun game v to play,5
good if only boom beach no time limit when fighting like this game last think you get an exxtras star for that you need to fix one thing those you need to be able to guide your troops then I would give you five stars I wish everything didn't cost so much I wish there were more ways to get resources then I would give you 5 stars,4
This game is fun the only thing I don't like about this game is that I have to buy the scenary and the costumes and the scenary is hard to get because I am not an adult I am 15and most people in my family are too busy to buy stuff for games and it's to know howuch fun people have with all their scenary and their costumes for their heroes,5
"I've lately been experiencing purchasing issues and it wasn't on my end that came the problem, for i had already purchased an offer using the same method of payment and it had proved to be successful..only now does the app deny my attempts to try again",4
"Overall gameplay is fantastic. Still have an issue with poison spell effecting troops, but not the troops on top of buildings.",5
Please don't make me say this game don't even open if i have good network . I must open the game loading just will be going on the loading just don't take off its like a strucked train don't even goo .. i left it open for half an hour and after that it opened when I wanna change account it happens again ... For some time I must on the aeroplane mode and off it to open,5
At first I was sad cause I had to get a new phone and I needed to login to my games but when I logged in to my supercell account my stuff would reset but after a couple months it finally did but that was my only problem overall this is one of the best games I ever played,5
"Since the new update, it's been crashing everytime I load it. It loads and then freezes on the builder base and crashes..",3
It's a good and addictive game but it always crash it loading is finished please fix it .If I want I can give you five rating also because of that crash I feel irritating always.,2
Whenever I try to attack the game crashes and thus I lose trophies it would be great if they could fix this issue otherwise the game is great,1
Game crashed in the builder base and i can't seem to log in anymore. This always happens whenever there's an update. Needed to be fixed immediately.,2
"overall the game is very fun to play, i gave it 4 stars the customization is very limited, even for the scenery you can't buy it using gems or you cant combine the sceneries.",4
I like the gane. Because there are lot strategy in this game. But there is thing that this gane is so much complicated. Because in recent update we have to focus on clan capital that's why i am confused that how i can play this in very low time. But this gane is amazing..,5
After the update all my stuff is not working what I got to see of it. All my buildings and artillery is as if I never upgraded it I was almost a town hall 10 and now I got to start all over again not cool.,1
"Hello clash of clans,, If the town hall is 15 make every defence and troops level should be 15 according to the town hall level all should be on according to town hall, town hall is 15 some are crossing 20' 18 it's not nice to see.. confuse Heros leve are going to cross 100 what is that , and the upgrading time is to long... Give less gold and elixir on loot increase the price and decrease the time. Fell Lazy of upgrading there should be different laboratory for dark elaxir troops and spell.",4
"After updating my Clash of Clan it is now automatically crashed and can't able to play anymore, been playing this game for almost 4yrs, tried initiating basic troubleshooting but it doesn't help.",1
The game is fun but I only have one problem with it and its always losing connection especially when im attack another base so I lost trophys because of that.,4
"I played it 6 years ago and still counting, my experienced was astonishing even now and for me it's a good game. I'm grateful playing this game because I can play it with my cousins and friends, we enjoy it and this is our way of bonding together.",5
"There's a glitch in training troops. If i have 1 barracks which can train electric dragon and others are not upgraded to the same level, it is creating a blockage to train other troops as well. The same is happening in dark barracks as well, in fact train in normal barracks is creating blockage to train in dark barracks as well. Fix this error.",1
I have been playing this game for 3 years now and this is the best game i have ever played and give a full dedication to it. The game play is strategic and that's the coolest part for me. Even if it tests my patience sometimes but its all worth it.,5
"Absolutely a great game!Been paying for so long but the game never gets boring.Also,thanks for putting troops free cz it rlly helps me save loot and resources!After all,I suggest you download this game if you're looking for an interesting game!",5
Been playing this for 4 years and have reached town hall 12. Highly recommend this game over brawl stars and clash royale. Those two games are way p2w. Clash of clans is one of the best supercell games and is most f2p friendly. It is very interactive and this game is very stratigical. Play for a few 2-3 years and you will have lots of fun. New players usually quit at town hall 7-8 so have some patience and you will LOVE 💕 this game. ;),5
After last upgrade... i can't play this game..when open coc it's freeze & always return to re start option.... if someone have any idea to solve this problem..please help me....,2
HORRIBLE SUPPORT-UNABLE TO FIX THEIR ISSUES. Clan Games finished and 12 hours later they had one of their famous updates. Couldn't get my rewards. What a waste of time. Hard to like a game where the developer can't support their product.,1
It would be great if we could cancel the super troops ... Coz we would like to cancel the current troops n uses another super troops.... Btw d game is fun....,5
I have a problem with loading.The game is not loading when i use my mobile network. It is only loading when i connect wifi. This game is awesome without these issues. Please fix it as soon as possible.Other wise i will have to take a decision to uninstall it☹️.,2
I am playing Coc for past 2 yrs but after the latest update in june 2022 my coc is crashing after loading and it gets stuck on the same screen after loading.I tried to uninstall and re-install but same problem happens.I also tried to clear cache but nothing is happening....may the developer team shed some light on it.....,3
It is a great game and I have played it for 3-4 years. A glitch did happen that made my account recet but it fixed its self when I uninstall then reinstalled.,5
It's one of best game i played but it's not opening after the update it's rarely open but now it's rarely open too just crashing or black screen I lost war and attacks because of this do some now,2
"A really fun game, sometimes frustrating but over all a great game to compete with your friends (you can even attack your friends villages)!",5
"good game but the way the troops target buildings makes me wanna throw a table at a daycare, for example, my dragon is closer to the town hall than the elixir storage, but the dragon still attacks the storage which is really stupid for a game about mindless troops attacking eachother",3
"Nice update with zero training cost at home Village. I stopped playing in 2014 and resumed again from last month. I always spend tine on calculating on return on investment/attack. Training cost - Loot Elixir, this is a bid update.",5
"The new update of free training cost is a bad idea. There is excitement in looting, i'm not excited anymore because my storage is always full.",2
"Great game,i've been play this game 8 or 9 years almost forgot,changing phone few times,still download back this games,my opinion is,create some update in personal profile,like date id created etc,how many wins,this things help some player remember how long they play this awesome game,nice too see some update like that",5
I really have enjoyed playing it. I also like the challenge of building a base and the resources you get if you lost defending against someone,5
"I've been playing this for years and this is the most mind-blowing update, having this free troops training makes the game accessible to new player and I can now invite my friends to play w/out them worrying about being to low level than me because they can still reach TH7 for like 3-4 weeks only or even 2 I guess",5
This is my boredome breaker game i was trying the auto upgrade feature but i can resist to play clash of clans and when the free pixel king arrived i couldn't resist it anymore for me this is the best game to play if you have free time and bored mostly this game is full of fun things i also like the new update that troops dont cost elixr now that actually made resources gathering easier this game deserves high rating,5
I had plaing this game from 2015 and it is very important to tell you all this game has no addiction but if you addict this game then you must upgrade you buildings for a long time and just leave for a week for better tackle attacking Thank you SUPERCELL team for this game and love you all,5
"This game is awsome very awsome,I played this game now for 2 years,now I am town hall level 9,but there is this problem where dark elixir is soo hard to grind and u need to get your king and queen to level 30,so,why don't u add like a way we can exchange coins and elixir to dark elixir.",5
"Beautiful game hadn't played this in years, I'm now rebuilding back , sry can't afford the perks of the game but I enjoy taking my time and building feeding off of different designs man some if guys could be strategist for the GOVERNMENT 😂 😂",5
This game is super fun and have had it for 5 years but recently it's been very slow and laggy and slow which hasn't been up and till now. If there's something I can do to fix this please let me know.,3
builder base is the most stupid game at all.. how can a smaller town hall win a fight with a bigger one while in the same level its hard to win for 100% ???? Should not match the player with the trophies for builder base but by town hall level!,1
"UPDATE I was finally able to get in the game and all is well. I updated, go back to login and keep getting the good news! There's an update and sends me back to the playstore, where I can do nothing because I already updated it!",5
This game is absolutely amazing.This was the first game I downloaded as a kid and it has great mechanics and overall the game play is really good.I also appreciate the fact that there are zones you can work at so it's more spread out.,5
"I would like to say about an addition to the game. Its about adding a free builder into the troop which is going to a loot attack(only if a builder is free in the base). This builder can be applied to collect any gem present under any trunk, tree or even gembox from the opposite base. It can be a try of luck for the attackers. Also the opposite defense will harm the builder too and that builder wont be available for 1 day. I just wanted to share my small thought. Thank you for such a great game",5
I've enjoyed playing this game for a fair few years now. The game can be a bit of a grind at times but because of the many different features within the game it's a case of the more you play the better rewards you receive.,5
This game is really fun and relaxing I love playing this game you upgrade everything and help each other out the more you upgrade and get things the more you can do on it at first the upgrades don't take that long to upgrade but the more you upgrade the longer it takes to upgrade things some things to upgrade takes 6 days to upgrade but you can use the gems to make it done right away I always upgrade the 8 hours or longer when I go to work and when I go to sleep then I get to upgrade more faster,5
"Love this game, really different from the others. I started playing 5 years ago and stop many times but it's easy to come back without losing your previous game. To the founder and creator, I would like to recommend to allow coc gamers to sell their gems that can be transformed into real money so our time and effort will be paid of. Hoping that soon Clash of Clans is not only for gamin but also an opportunity to earn small money while enjoying the game. Big respect to the founder and creator.👍",5
There's a problem when I log into the game when I log in it loads a little bit and the screen turns black and exits the game it doesn't happen in my tablet but my phone it always keeps happening I've tried clearing the date and cache didn't work tried reinstalling the game didn't work I've even tried to unsync my other accounts in my other device didn't work I even uninstall coc to my other device to make sure that no acc is sync to let my phone log in but didn't work It really piss me,1
"For the trouble of collecting raid medals the rewards shown in the market is very unuseful. Only main use is to get cc troops when noone is donating them otherwise it doesn't make any sense as u never get builder potion, super potion or any book for that matter.",4
black star for the latest update if possible. literally remove one of the reason why i like the game. totally different back when you really need to grind looting elixir for training your troops and for upgrades.,1
"after installing new update the game repeatedly crashes and restart the logo but after reinstalling and trying different devices, nothing is solved. Fix the issue asap.",1
It is very entainmental and good game for villagers who cannot play whole day .they can upgrade building and do their work and play when they were free that's why this is good game 🎮 for me but it's upgrade many take long time and builder potion received less and i think supercell have to take a new update that we can donate our resources and gems to other clan mates because they also our .,5
I personally have met many new people and have had an overall exciting game experience. As someone who plays many video games over the years this is definitely in the top five.,5
This is so frustrating😠...8 months ago I decided to stop playing this game because am already TH 12 but before that l created supercell ID. Now I want to play it again and continue but when I try to change account the supercell ID appears and it wants me to login to load my old village so I put my email address and it says a verification code was sent to it but I didn't receive a code so now I can't load my old village anymore. CAN I JUST LOAD MY VILLAGE USING MY GOOGLE ACCOUNT ONLY I need help,5
"I've been playing for years and I absolutely love this game. Whenever they add new features, they are always enjoyable. I play with my friends and it's something we all enjoy. Highly recommend this game. It's the only one that keeps my attention for years at a time!!",5
"The new update 90s game was is good idea. But it's not ok for play. Very lagging, very slow, more bugs. Please gives proper updates. ( I love this games)",4
"Bring back global chat and I'm rating it 5 star Edit: this is actually serious but I can't login with my main account anymore. The app works fine when my main account is not logged in but when i logged it in, the app will crash. Idk what happened Edit: it was fixed a long time ago but still 1 star cuz no global chat",1
"The game is nice and all but to be honest from my own point of view I don't like the fact that to train army is free , because what else am I meant to use my dark elixer for it's just there piling up with no where else to go It just took the fun of hardwork out of it",3
There will have another update of this app that it upgrades wall segments without builder....because when gold and elixir are more we get attacked back to back by others...and we don't have any idea that where we use that gold and elixir....so think on that.. thank you...😊,5
Clash of Clans is the best game I have played it feels like its never going to end you have always got something to do and you get a sense of happiness every time you finish upgrading somethin or win a battle.,5
The game is exallent .but the time taken for upgrade troops and buildings are to heavy at TH 12.if reduce the time it will help to better..,4
"I would haven given this game 5 star but this game is very easy now I used to play this game from 3 years but the prices are getting very low I unlocked Xbox at 3000000 but now it's price is 1000000 and level 2 is 1,6,00000 it is not fair for old players",3
A update waiting fr ages!!! The heroes should be allowed to use in warand CWL even during Upgrade in home Village. Or its boring during Upgrade becz u normally are unable to clear opponenets. Hopefully it cones soon!!!,3
I love the game it is so fun I recommend you play it 😃😃 I've played it for 5 years and I love the game the game never gets old. My clans is Masked Athletes. I am currently on TH-5 but I just started it I am never going to uninstall it. Play it do it it's free. You won't regret it. I'm telling you play it it it now :D,5
I love this game but the update with the arcade games is weird. FIX CLASH DASH ITS CONTROLS SUCK! It is unfair to the player if the controls don't work. Please fix it.,4
"Clash of Clans is one of the best games of all time. While it added townhall 14 last year and most likely townhall 15 this year, it still go through some other updates which is great. Thanks Clash of Clans!!!",5
Game is awesome. App developers and customer service sucks. I've lost 2 out 5 accounts and I've spent a couple hundred dollars on a few accounts and I get zero help. Sad because the game is awesome,3
"The game's really good, still my favourite strategy game, but ever since the update, I noticed a glitch, I only see the shadows of deployed troops, and wizards and archers on the defence towers don't show anynore",4
"I just want you guys to know that there is a bug in the new update, I can't see the troops in the game. I mean just like the archer tower, all I can see is the tower but there is no archer there. I hope you can fix this quick. Thanks a lot",4
"Started playing in 2015, had ups and downs and still playing it. That's got to mean its a pretty good game. Recent updates have really improved play but still looking forward to th15 😉👍",5
"'The bestest game' in my whole gaming life❤️.... whenever I'm thinking about games then first my mind remembers that mysterious magical forest, clans, villages, war legacies, special troops from clash arena...& all of this crazy things are always making me excited to comeback in my village and lead my clan again😌😌...Best game ever🌟",5
"I really like this game. It is the coolest game I had never played. But the problem of mine is, please can you guys add private text and attack your friends or clan mates. Anyway cool app👍👍🕺",5
"If there is a better free to play game out there I would like to know what it is. There is absolutely no requirement to put in money, no ads you have to work around and you can progress through the game at a reasonable pace.",5
Becoming the most worst game!!! I can't even log in to my account which I've been playing for years!! Worst game management!!! Supercell I'd is not working!!! I've lost my account. Now I'm thinking why I'm wasted my time in playing this game for years. 🙁💔,1
Why are the updates so problematic. The app doesn't work after the updates... A black screen appears and the screen hangs.... Please check.,1
I been playing this game for almost ten years. It's great and all but the higher u get the harder it is to stay interested in game play. For example: I play COC every three days suppose to when I first stared.,5
"I have 1 problem when i tried to login onto my other email,at supercell id, and need a verification code but it didn't sent. I keep trying and refreshing and checking but it still didn't send it, but when i register my other acc the code was sent for registration, but not the verification code for the login.",3
"Hope u seen last review I was asking to reduce time for training, buildings and upgrade I can see all happened in next update the troop training doesn't cost elixir I am very very happy u r seeing these kind of reviews from players and working on it clan capital, super troops, cwl, in last few years I can see amazing updates by supercell it is very cool excited to see how the game will be at 2030 ( if I alive 😅)",5
This is a great game! However I rate this a four because when I would brew potions it would get rid of it after a couple minutes.,4
"Helo supercell , I'm playing this game from 2 years and I've enjoyed this game a lot but after update my game is full laging so how can i solve this problem. Give me solution for this problem. I hope you will understand my problem.",3
"After this latest update, two of my accounts here cannot be loaded properly and crashes the application. In a span of two days this problem was resolved by Google play and COC update.",5
"The update is nice but i cant guarantee that i can win full star in my every attack cause its is always higher rank than mine and when i saw a 1 town hall lower than me, the trophy is much lower than before just like....only 5 trophies......so i only gave 3 stars",3
"I am not able to seeing after zoom, that great hd graphics after this big update, please solve the problem early as possible, it is irritating me a lot!",1
Thank you so much supercell for each and every feature you added to the game after the update. I was so happy when I found out that we can upgrade walls with elixer on town hall 8 too.,5
This game is so amazing and fun. Don't reduce too much upgrading time.. it a disappoinment if the lower got up so easily.. challenge them. Don't let them take it easy,5
"the game is good and fun but after the last update my clash of clans started crashing a lot of times, i dont know if its a problem with my phone or clash of class but please do something about it!!",3
"The games is great but i don't know why the app can ""load"" in the loading screen it seems to be stuck or a bug I tried to re- install the game but nothing happens pls fix this problem",3
"after reset update it crashes right after loading the village, reinstalled it default village load ok but as soon as i reload my village it crashes again! what is going on!",3
It is so fun and easy usally games like this id get bored ans get rid of it within a week but this game is so fun ive had it for over two years now and u can decorate ur island and there r always new updates that just make the game better and when u battle u dont habe to worry some one being better than u they see what leage u r in and place u with other people the same as u i would recomend this 100%,5
"Worst game... once we start winning good amount of trophies, after that we do not get chance to win more trophies, we get very less trophies to play with",1
"This game is fantastic but from a week it takes too much time to load and sometimes it totally stops loading, issue of concern, Need to be fix immediately.",1
This game is great the graphics are good the sound affects are good the only bad thing is when you get things to higher level they take so long to upgrade but over all great game,5
"The only problem that I'm facing is that the people who attack on my base are of really high town hall like I'm th 7 and the people who attack me have archer queen and all which unlocks at th 9 overall this game is very good, very addicting, and a time killer",4
very nice game but its very slow based too if you are f2p they tried to fix things like u dont have to let heros rest after every fight which is nice. but would have been better to make troops training faster.,3
this game is very good and i came back to play again and again to the first can I reduce the upgrade time because it's tedious to wait and I also don't have gems and I don't have to buy gems to finish immediately if it's possible 😅😅,5
This is very nice game with attractive graphics.The only thing you want to play this game is patience.This game took years to complete.You can develop your own attack strategy by using your skills. I am playing this game for more than years.Still i am not complete.In my opinion this is the best strategy game i ever played....,5
Good game but problem is when war match draws(both team score full stars) they should decide win or lose as per avg time taken or other factors.. Coz we made streak so long since months and it got broke coz of draw match.. SO PLS DO THIS CHANGE OR ELSE I'm NOT IN MOOD TO MAKE MORE STREAKS AND PLAY WARS 🥲,1
"The game is really great, I have been playing this game since 2017 , it's a GOAT, But the only problem,plz improve the AI for the heroes (Archer Queen in particular ), it's just too frustating, other than that the game is all fine",5
"This quite an impressive game when I play so far. But in game every defence we built there is lot of days are been taken there so, please decrease the time when we are building the defence .otherways play this game lot of fun and relax .",5
5 stars but... The new update where troops are free. I mean COME ON! It takes the fun out of attacks. Fix it please. And also Please watch. I want the old clash of clans back. By beakers lab.,5
Its a beautiful well arranged game. I loved to play it & enjoy it so very much. Its killing my sadness & a borring time as well. Finally i would like to say in lowar level clan the troops should be more harder.,5
I have tried to contact through email and recieved a reply saying to contact through ingame help and support. When using help and support I recieve the same bot reply saying that noting is wrong with my account eventhough Iknow that someone else is also using it.,3
"I like this game, this game is fun to Play but one thing is that it takes a lot of time in upgrading defenses, buildings etc. Still it's a good game and I love it and that's the only reason I rated this game 5 stars because it's fun game..... It's a good game and we can easily play with friends",5
Anyone have the same error as i do? The error is when i tey to open the game it self closes and this error occurred after the sneak pick update please help i do not know what to do. Overall it's a great game,3
"Why does this ask me to review when I,ve already reviewed? It's a bit hard to move things because it will excange an item of the same kind if you move it over another of the same kind and therefore does nothing. Also it selects things to move even if you click beside the item instead of on it. You should make it so it only slects when you click ON the thing not beside it and only moves it if you click ON and not beside the item.",5
I wanted to come back after a few years to play with friend but they deleted my town hall 9 village because of inactivity and since it's in their TOS that they can delete for inactivity after 180 days I can't do nothing about it . Just lost much money and time for no reason . Won't start from 0 again.,1
"It is a superb strategic game. Just build defenses,resources,upgrade them and attack💣💣💥💥But the buildings take much of time to upgrade...",4
"Fun game but waiting times on building is rediculous.. 11+ hours.. I'm not playing all I'm doing is waiting to tap build and wait even longer, my banks are full.. no fast forward.. good game don't get me wrong but you get so bored of waiting about all the time",2
"What a decade! Nice game entertainmentfull and playable more. And you will feel glad about the game and clans make it perfect, also the raid medals, you gotta call me twice to use it perfect game for me I hope everyone would have this game Nice game.",5
"The new update on the clan capital where the number of attacks left are displayed on the home village is broken. Whenever i open the app, it shows that i still have 5 raid attacks even though i dont have any left. Love you.",5
I had a one-star rating because I was unable to get the gold pass and I paid for it. I have since fixed the issue but the reason I'm still leaving it one star is there was zero effort to help. They didn't care about this one star so I'm going to keep it one star!,1
"I was enjoyed again playing with my COC, after 6 years of playing. I perhaps burden to win because of the powerful forces of opponents. But ones again, more again and be children's friendly.",4
Im very disappointed with this game i played since 2015 till now i lost my account after i login to supercell id there was no Account found and when i check my email my old account still linked with my gmail when i try to login the game automatically go to supercell and when i enter my supercell account there was no account found I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED i make a report still no reply RIP COC GIVE MY ACCOUNTS BACK I WASTE 7 YEARS TO IMPROVE MY VILLAGE!!!,1
The reason why 4 star. Why after a battle does the surviving troops disappear as well.. how come not send them back to camp after the battle.. other than that the game is extremely recommend,4
"Been playing this for years. I love this game, it's a game you can pick up play it for a while and then put down. I haven't put a dime in it and it hasn't held me back yet. Just takes a while to upgrade things later on",5
So I started playing this in 2019 AND IT IS AMAZING you can strategize your army's moves and you even have another base to work on by using the boat to get to it so in my overall opinion it is one of the best strategy games I've played,5
I've been playing for about 8 years now and the game is continually fun and interesting to play. The new updates keep it fresh and I always find myself finding things to do.,5
"Hey I'm playing this game since 2018,Its very nice game and still i'm playing even i have no complains about it,you have made very nice game SUPERCELL.Jun 28,2022 is a very nice update in which we can train the troops in no cost but supercell why you took away the flags.It was very nice decore please bring it back.",4
"I love this game. it never gets old and is always fun. I like how supercell made troop training free. my army was always in the 300,000s. but now it's free. that helps me out alot",5
"can we expect a th15 in the future? most of my clanmates played since this game started an until now. sad to say, most of them also went inactive after reaching the th14 and nothing to upgrade. we only play in the home village, cause thats where we started, we are 40 years old and some are in there 50s, u know why i am saying the age.",3
Well I've been playing the game for a long time. Love the updates specially the clan capital update but the decision to remove the elixir to train troops doesn't seem good to me.,5
"best game i have ever played, this game is a masterpiece, i have been playing it since 2014 with my cousins and friends,i remember us making theories that supercell will add a canon on top of the town hall and a giant goblin, i will never forget this game, thank you supercell.",5
I love this game it is peacefull you can't rage only thing I'd say is kinda bad about this is the cosmetics they are expensive and say for us summer kids if we have nothing to do then we can be pretty bored because this game consumes time but other than that I love it but now the game arcade this is hard as hell anf the dumb racing game doesn't work. And when a barb punches a goblin it does nothing so please fix this supercell,4
Regeneration is too long - troop upgrades are way too long! It's a fun and other than the waiting period it's fun.,1
Game is more interesting and addictive.. cannot talk with friends in the game ...if it is enabled to talk with friends it will be nice social game like other games ..we can communicate with our friends in the game,1
"Hey, uh, why does the game keep crashing after the new update ? The June 2022 update keeps crashing the game everytime I open it. Please look into the matter.",4
"I am planning to get back/ return to the game today coz I stopped playing maybe 2017-2018 but when I am retrieving my account, they blocked my acccount which is the only account that I can play because it is the only account connected on my main email. I am really disappointed. You are blocking someone who is trying to retrieve an account 🖕",1
I'm Playing this game for past 4 years..fine one and I loved it.The only issue is make the constructing time(days) to less.waiting for it makes me sometimes too angry..make this a review to your attention and make it soon as less timing for construction,4
"Everything was perfect, i am. Playing this game since 2014. One thing which made it little boring is ""No Global Chat"" much difficult to find a better clan, tough to recruit good players now. Please bring ""Global Chat again"".",4
Excellent game everybody should download this but it Lags somewhere and it takes like 40 to 50 seconds to open . And please add 2 trophs in like 3 to 4 years,4
Game is so good. Please remove the timing of troop. It make people to play game some people not play this game because they do not have the time.so please remove the timing of troops. that's the reason I am giving 1 Star for this game,1
My phone has 3gb game and this game is only of 250 mbs but it acts like bgmi and more than bgmi . It crashes regularly even when I am attacking in the wars . So give this game only one star please fix these issues and I delete this game. Thank you,1
"This is a mind blowing game and the structure of this game is also impressive. I hope in the future updates, the game will be more nice. But I am giving this game 4stars because of a few Errors... But the game is very nice to play.",4
"Hate the AI's at versus battles, once a range unit locks on it locks on, ignoring other buildings and such, like my archers locking on to a building and ignoring a crusher that was right infront of them and then proceed to get closer to the crusher until they get crushed",3
"I lost my account, tryna get it back so i contacted the help centre to find help. I didn't play the tutorial i just went to settings to access the help centre but a few minutes ago i went and check the message in help centre and i got banned on the main screen. Explanation Supercell?",1
I have increased the star from 1 to 5 becz there is a lot of improvement. But there are still some bugs which makes my phone freeze while attacking. I can't drop my troop sometimes.,5
"Lots of love to coc, but i would like to give you one suggestions on which you should work . Ans that is to reduce the amount of cache data. Except from this issue everything is of 1st class.",5
the game was challenging and requires a lot of thoughtful planning before going unto battles. It was fun.,5
Very nice game I am playing this game sins 3 years and the updates are making game more interesting but I think is that it has very low amount of gems after completing mission and upgrades are having very much time please deduct the upgrade times,4
Didn't update two days ago and now I am no longer able to play my Clash of Clans. I don't know what happened there but it just keeps crashing and then shuts down by itself. If you could please get this issue fixed so those of us who had that problem we will be able to start playing again,5
Great game but I have been playing this game from the the past 5 years it's been my favourite game but I wanted to update my gmail account so I disconnected it so that I may reconnect it with my new gmail account but In the process i lost my account i even ask for help from the help and support but they said please wait and no response till now so disappointed 😔😔 Hope you guys can get my account back🤧🤧,2
"A good game but IT REALLY STRESSES Me out when I can't receive my Verification code. I AM STUCK. But although THIS IS A GOOD STRATEGIC GAME but the upgrade time is MENTAL, 6 days for ONE air defense??? Are you out of your mind???‽",4
Alot better but still couldn't find my old bases! But still playing this game for years and I never get bored of it! Lost 5 bases and my 6h is a TH12 again! Well might be 7th time my phone took a dump again!,4
"Love the game but after the latest update one of my builders is gone, like I have 4 and it always just says 3/4 are available last one is no where to be found lol, if someone can get in touch with me I can send screenshots and all that!",5
"It fun to play when you have nothing better to do. The only problem is how much resources you need for an upgrade and the time it takes to upgrade it. Other than that, it's a great game.",4
"In this busy World we don't have time to wait for training the troops, but we have lots of resources for troops training cost. I don't like this ""no cost troop training"" update. For this update, do decrease the training time of troops.",2
"You just ruined the game by the new update ..... Making training cost of troops zero means making regular players and non regular players same .... I've been playing clash of clans for 3 years and own 6 IDs , but after your update I would be unable to play the game with same enthusiasm 😔... Go play with your game supercell .",1
You should download this game because it is full of fun you can play it with your friends. I would like to thank supercell because they did the army training free. I am at townnhall 10 and it is very helpful.,5
"This game is good very recommendable i love it since i was in high school this is the only game that i never felt boring all good.. the game, the quality, the resolution and i don't have any problem when playing this game (smooth) every update is interesting",5
"This game was earlier used to be very interesting but no idea for what the reason they've added builder base, builder base troops are very useless when they're deployed they get finished easily. My builder hall is of level5 and I always find players in versus battle having builder hall of level 6 and 7 they should make compete players of same builder hall level because players having higher level builderhall would have more scope of victory and I used to have more than 2100 and now it's 1700😡",4
I came back after a years but still fun to play and more features still the no.1 and the only king and I believe it is still growing until this year..keep up the good work!!! 💯❤,5
This game is crazy and awesome.i love to play this game but only issue is upgrade time after th 13is very long.so I have to wait for long time so please minimize the upgrade time so we can play continuously,5
"So clash of clans is the best game ever literally. You can build,fight,team,etc...🤪👍 But there is something bad in it😭,so you should wait hours and hours to get your building done.Now I'm townhall level 5 and waiting for the spellfactory to be done it takes 7 hours.But its more that good🤪❤",5
i already have great time to this kind of game for about 10 years... i wish the laboratory can ups both troops and spell in the same time.. add free space pls .. because its too slow to ups one by one... pls add space for that... thanks so much ... have a blessed day to your team🥰🥰🥰,5
its a good game my only concern is the upgrading of all the buildings it is way to long maybe you can make it a little bit more shorter than the previous upgrade time,4
"After latest update, I'm always facing loading issue. Whenever I try to load to my village it's says network problem, please try again. Though my WiFi is working fine. It's started after the latest update.",1
Takes way to long to find a match that is worth it. You lose way more medals on defense in comparison to offense. Makes the game boring.,1
The new features is okay but now we have more elixir and the building time is huge. Any chance try reducing the building time plus reduce the gem price for the builders and also add some more builders. But after all love this game 🎮 ❤,4
I lost my phone. And its about 3 day that I am in contact with supercell with new account because I can not get a SMS to recover my account. They ask me every time a new question. But this morning when I opened the game i received a message that wrote you are banned for 31 day because of offensive messages.,1
Latest update June 2022 makes it so I cannot upload my saved game. Been playing for years and my player screen comes up and closes the app. Samsung tab T715 running Android 7. Please fix.,1
"The most dumbest update ever for this game, giving zero cost for troops. What's the point? Other than letting new low level players build up their base to catch up with us who have been playing for years",1
"Best strategy based war game I have ever played. The structure, level and graphics are just awesome.",5
"The game is great, but the community of coc is all around the world. Because of that, some clan have different language while using the chat box or whatever you call that. I just suggesting add automatic translation to english. Just english, because English is the most use language all around the world.",5
"Lame Lame Lame, the latest update and Challenge requires the purchase of the GOLD PASS each Month to receive 75% of the loot earned. It's been fun, but the latest update is nothing more than a cash grab. I'm done",1
"It's a good strategy game...very easy concept, no complexity and it also have good graphics...I love this game very much.",5
"After this update, one thing i like the most is that you can train your troops for free!!!!!!! Although i like almost all the features added in this update. Thank u supercell for this amazing update.",5
this game is very challenging you have to wait to get stronger and it's very hard to make attacks you need to study each attack in the game well but if you wait you will achieve the taste of success this game is so good 💞,5
Playing the game eversince 2015.. its my experience that tell that the game is not at all boring..... Recently i installed it again and loaded my max th12 base and now i am more exited to go to th14... supercell keeps the game updated and enjoyble...... overall its the best game for phones🙂,5
I've been playing coc for more than 6 years (approx) and I've never felt bored by this game although the coc server has to be updated. Unless they fix this they may lose many of their gamers.Anyway i loved this game.😊😊😊,5
"My favorite game honestly. I stopped playing almost a year ago because of training cost, i start losing all of my elixir for just to train army. I started playing again because you guys removed training costs",5
I recently started the game and immediately got hooked to it. The detail and the gameplay is amazing and there are no adverts to interrupt your gameplay. Would recommend to big gamers across the globe 🌎,5
"This game is a mobile classic. Ever since I downloaded it it has had me hooked on its fun and addictive gameplay. Recommended to any mobile gamers who probably have already heard of it, or even casual gamers",5
The dragons always go sideways. They always focusing their way to the side even if i have troops to clear those sides. What have you done to dragons to this new update this is so stressing out!,1
Very fun game lots of effort has been put into this game the only I dont like and I know that supercell won't change is the build time I have been grinding for years and I'm only on town hall 9,4
Update causes my forge to be invisible and the mines have not stopped being boosted in over a month sometime I can log on other times I get wifi bars and crash I asked support about this and nothing still no response plz fix these problems soon,1
Any one hacked my account. but supercell team deleted my account. when I will connecting supercell my account after hacked someone. So don't connect your account in supercell. Stay in Google account.that was better. I think who is hacking well easily get every supercell connecting account's 😂😂,1
"Game is crashing like hell. we need less time to upgrade time things so all player can play bring back global chat so clasher unite, great game though. Thanks for great update we needed the most now we can make revenue in resources which we couldn't Earlier.",3
Highly addicting time waster. You will need to spend some money to speed the slow progress. It is woth the cost of entertainment.I love it.,5
"Good game, but the updates brick my galaxy view for 8-10 weeks each update.. it will not load, it tries to load but then disconnects and reloads over and over... sames as before , do not update if you have a galaxy view",1
May I suggest supercell that. There must be a sign of active status on players on the clan not only in the social. like the green circle on messenger to know if our co players are active. thank you💞 Theres a bug in builder base when trying to open one of my account it keeps exiting the game. please help,4
This game is very good and enjoyable but recently I redownload game and made my own clan and tried to invite people through invite people but when I opened there were no people showing up even I tried every single type for people to show up there.i believe this should be fixed.,3
I have really enjoyed the latest updates....it's a great job done by supercell...i have never given a review for any application i have ever used ...this is the first time I am reviewing an application...so i hope you know my level of happiness...😄😊💯❤️😍,5
"Amazing strategy game, if you get bored of it, then I don't know what's real anymore. The combinations that you can create in this game are endless. I strongly suggest it for aspiring minds.",5
Found this game to be pretty entertaining on and off for several years. Very interesting to find that I've been banned from the game without warning after several years and several hundred dollars. This is fraud.,1
"Edit: Demoted to 1 star 'cause it's so frustrating when my base gets attacked by players 1 or 2 levels above me. It's so unfair that they already have spells and troops that can wipe out my defenses so easily. I will uninstall this game if this goes on, it's not fun at all. At least make your game fair knowing its already very tedious to play.",1
I enjoy the game but the game surrendering me immediately after I get disconnected from my wifi despite having a full army and spells is just kinda ridiculous especially that it's happened more times than I can count including in war,1
"Awesome game I've had 3 different accounts and missed it like mad every time I lost one. Best phone game I've ever played I can't recommend enough, if u haven't lose ur coc virginity and don't look back.",5
The whole clan capital experience for me has been so bad. It always exits the game when i open clan capital...in clan raids I can't even use my attacks properly. Please fix this supercell...others are good. Very nice game,3
"My clash of clans hangs and jumps out when i want to see the enemy base #1 in the clan war. Please help me , it's unfair war because i can't see anything of base #1 and maybe i can't attack him after war stars.",3
"It will be more fun if we can upload profile picture and clan logo picture, hoping to see this feature in clash of clan ASAP. And we should be able to upgrade hero level 5 at once it takes too much time tho upgrade hero..",5
"The game is good, well recommend. My only opinion is put country selection for clan members. So we can compete in other country players. Just simply put choices which country you want to team up. Example I'm a Filipino i I want a clan that only Filipino player is on that clan. I hope you can make actions on that thankyou",4
"Nice game, really fun to and fair to all players. I am very much addicted to it. My only problem is that i can't link it to Supercell when ever i try it doesn't send any code to my email address please fix it",4
"Everyhing seems to work fine now. Still sorry I lost my previous games because had to reinstall. I've lost my account for ther third time! I am now starting over for the third time. Lost account is also Durk65, Clan Irish-Trojans. I have alos lost an account on my ipad. When I gave recovery info I was told I was trying to steal someone else account. Ten years of building lost on that one. Just recovered my Durk65 account over one year later. You need a better way so accounts are not lost.",5
Your app is so ridiculous I am so done with it disconnects everytime and u can't blame internet for it cuz it only happens here other games run smoothly if it disconnected once I can understand but every single second please handle this problem soon 🤬🤬🤬,1
I went back to my base and saw a lot of new challenges. I was so happy but I wish it's the same with my former clanmates. They can't retrieve their accounts. It's hard to go back from start.,3
Everything is getting better and better.. Wishing they start letting us earn crypto coin while playing the game... It will take the game to the next level and attract more crypto hunters...,4
"Game crashes constantly after this new update, which is ultimately ok because the game isn't fun anymore and hasn't been for a long time.",1
I have been playing this game when th 11 was new and the game was really very hard at that time coz the only way of earning was attack and mines but the game has became far easier since the day cgs and seasons are added.But for sure better game then any other,5
"I love this game,simple great...just the versus battle...how cn i get gold, elixer and trophy when my enemy already at builder 5 and im at builder 4, enemy with mortar and i dont...",5
"It was the best strategy game for me I'm having fun playing it for the longest time.this is the only supercell game that didn't bore me,hope there's more to come,more update and upgrade.thanks SUPERCELL for bringing CLASH OF CLAN and also to SIR DARIAN KEEP IT UP. XOXO",5
This is one of the best games that I have ever played you get to hang out with friends you get to talk to friends be able to talk to people around the world I would rate this as a five star video game and whoever wants to start playing you should get into it because it is awesome,5
"I love it. Because it's about staritigy like don't bunch up all your troops to 1 big pile if you do the mortors will kill not instantly but if you bunch up your archers , barbarians , goblins and stuff with low health so don't bunch up your troops with low health.",5
"Its fun, relaxing and you can include your friends. I really enjoy the game especially now with all the new features. And the best is its free to play.",5
"This games is so good but after the last update it harm my device. I paly games but suddenly this app doesn’t work.when i try to open it but always failed. Then i reinstall the game and play. But after some moment create the same problem.so,i uninstall the game. Please remove this problem and Fixed the game.",5
"Playing this game since early 2016. Never got bored, coz the developers are always there adding more enjoyable and attractive contents. Regular updates keep me stuck to this game ""EVERY GAME IS TEMPORARY BUT CLASH OF CLANS IS PERMANENT""",5
"Very good strategical game with cute graphics.❤️😊I am playing this game since 2016 and I know how this game improved so much in 6 years .so, I think this is the best game ,I ever played .😁 Thank you supercell for making such a excellent strategic game.👍👍🙂🙂",5
The most recent update is the most questionable thing that has ever happened in coc why keep the game the same for soooooo long and then make such a huge change and take purpose away from one of the main resources contemplating deletion- There is close nothing to spend elixir on I have had a max elixir storage for close to a month and a half and I have gotten close to no elixir in the season pass bank because I can't gain anymore from battles with an already full elixir storage and I bought pass,1
I have an account which was lost I tracked it and asked supercell of help I sent out emails and everything There is just no support provided for this game This is just pathetic I mean not having support of such a huge game Don't get me wrong there is supprt I can't just see that it is helping The support is just as a name it doesn't do anything Atleast for me can't speak for others,1
"Great game. If only I could learn how 2 get my man 2 potato me that much attention,add he does this game. But great graphics, story line, characters. Loving it!!!",5
I really love this game I was playing it when i had 7 years ago wich means 5 years and I also love the game's channel in youtube and I really wish to the channel make a movie for clash of clans because their video are so fantastic.Anyway thanks for the game and the productors,5
It says that I need to update the game but when I go to playstore it's saying play and there's no update button. I can't open the game so please fix this problem. Thank you,5
The game is nice but after the last update my game is laggy nd many times it just hang nd show me a black screen nd now i can't even login please fix this and now it's getting worse my screen got blacked whilw attacking fix this game !!!,1
Exceptional and mind blowing game I think they should make an option where you can assign builders to build other buildings when they're done with the previous ones ... instead of them idling waiting for one to comeback online.,4
"I play a few mobile games, but never liked the look or the hype of COC. My daughter and her husband play Clans and always bugging me to join, so I did. Now I am leveling up, building my fort and kicking some butt. I'm glad I picked it up, now my mobile gaming is a family affair. Daughter, Send me troops!",3
"The game is now more easy and less intriguing due to the new update. Good news for the new players, but not for the loyal gamers who played for a long time. Developers could face a backlash for it.",2
This is the best strategy game I have ever played in my life.it has a great calligraphy and also smooth to play. I have been playing for almost 2 year and never been disappointed with this game. I just love it❤❤,5
Download this game if you need some peace this game is super chill game mechanics and features are very very good and top of all of that you can battle with your own barbarian and make a clan in the game and this game even has esport section this is the best mobile game I ever played in my life Thank You Clash OF Clans for this wonder full experience.,5
Great game with an amazing community. Unfortunately with the new update it keeps crashing in the builder hall for me. Hopefully there will be a fix for it.,4
"The troops being free makes me always wanna play it...i mean, i can now train troops without worrying about my resources! Tho in exchange was the duration of my shields...its worth it cuz i get trophies tho",5
I love this game but there is one problem I was saving up 1000 gems for the builder but went I went to put a decoration in the stash I lost 500 gems which is so annoying and if you can fix this glitch it will be appreciated alot but if it was not for that it is a grateful game,5
"It is my favourite game, however after this most recent update my game crashes to the point where I can't log in. It is frustrating. Can I please get assistance..........",1
"Poor network connection problems. I have 70mbps connection, still getting connection issues. I have few heavy games, they run smoothly. Getting worse",1
"Hi to the devs I just updated the game and it keeps closing when I try to open the game right after the update, I tried uninstall/install the game but its same. Please fix it , Thank you.",3
It is a very fun and challenging game. What I love is that is an online game and I can play with my friends and also teaches somethings about stragety to win.,5
I love this game so I gave 5 stars I am playing from 6years but I want more season and challenges everyday and clan game I love this game so much but it always crashes recently I have been deleting tha app and installing again whenever I open it crashes so please check it,5
"1) This game is not addictive like pubg 2) Teaches you about patience and calmness 3) first update all the defence then upgrade your TH otherwise you feel boring afterwards when you defence will weak 4)you need a good clan for making this game so interesting..go for 30/30 or 25/25 to get good golds, elixir 5) This game launches so many good updates which you love to play Overally , this is the best game I have ever played in my life . It's not so competitive.",5
it doesn't function well.. I lost my trophies cause this app always backing and always say connection lost but my connection is stable also my phone's not full storage,1
"The best strategy game I have ever found, the only complain is..... there is no complaint, one of the living legends, if you have more time to play, then there is so much content for you...... Just install once and find a clan suitable to your taste I gurantee you will definitely enjoy this game!",5
"Totally love this game. Always something to accomplish. Keeps me out of trouble for hours. Had issues after last update yesterday, but today another update fixed everything.",5
"June 2022 update seems to be buggy ... app now refuses to load and run ... just crashes, even after clean re-install and restart!",3
"You guys have done a great job by adding the Supercell Account feature, the advantage of the Supercell Account is that we don't have to download unnecessary clone apps and In the new update, you can easily use multiple accounts. Thank you 😊",5
"This game's a bit old now to enjoy and get obsessed with.. Please try something of different genre supercell. Heard about 3new games years ago, still haven't launched in India. Would love to try those new ones! Good luck making those and releasing ASAP here in India!",3
"I am very happy with the change that Clash of Clans has made for this new update. Thanks to the creators and thanks to the successful Supercell team. And I had a question, is the training of the force lasting forever? Please answer my question for sure",5
"I really love clash of clans I've been playing since 2009 I think when I'm highschool with my hs friends, its very easy to come back even do I don't play it with months. I really recommend it to play you this such very good game. It's super awesomeness 😻",5
I love this game so much I cannot put down the phone. If anyone who wants to download this you totally should. I got most of my family to play in 2015 and we are all still playing! This I a great game supercell just needs to add more updates for max town hall 14s,4
"I noticed the game is becoming less and less popular in my country. updates are not enough to attract more players. Bring back global chat,it will create more players interaction.",3
"I love this game and have been playing for years, but recently the game locked up and soon as it loads it closes. I have tried contacting supercell and they will not help",4
seriously?? pixels....???? what a big down grade to the game .... pixel skin of king isa really awfull looks like struck by at unstable internet connection.... sad to say I'm disappointed ..... I was expecting a more flashy anniversary rewards and event but all we got is a pixel version of the game.....,2
I rate it 1★ because I purchased builder + 500gems in shop for just P149.00 but I didn't receive the builder and 500 gems they said that wait for the confirmation for about 24hrs but no response and no email from supercell I feel that I had been scammed. I dont want any purchase from supercell anymore if they didnt fix this issue of mine.,1
"It's good to be back after 7 years of not playing, a lot of things have been changed and it's still simple and amazing game, good job developers!.",5
A little grindy but I love it. Been playing almost daily for over 2 years now and made it to town hall 12. (Non rush) Can't wait to see what's next!,5
I absolutely love playing clash on my down time. Doesn't take up time or effort. Games are to have fun and be stress free and COC does that.,4
"Uninstalled 3x and it still crashes. DFWWY CoC Update: As of July 30th 2022, this app continues to Force Close in the middle of a battle. I was trying to go beyond 5200 but CoC continues to crash. DaFaq",1
The game is getting worse day by day My phone is absolutely fine but idk why whenever I open coc it lags too much and my phone starts hanging on the other hand whenever am playing other games like bgmi or cod my device doesn't even hang for a second Please fix this as soon as possible,1
"This is by far the coolest game I've found for any phone or tablet devices. I literally have multiple clash of clans accounts that I play on every single day. The only complaint I can say about Clash of Clans is the ""reporting"" system and players being easily banned (temporarily or permanently) because people can simply click a person's comment and hit ""report."" So be VERY mindful of your communication on the game. Even with a filter option you still can't speak freely on there.",5
"why is it that when I attack the enemy I only get 12 to 18 trophies even with three stars. but when the enemy attacks my base, they get 25 to 35 trophies when they have three stars. where is the justice for me.😥😒😢",1
Please update your network reconnection issue. I faced issue many times while i'm attacking in war. Please fix it or i will unistall this game. There is no fixes for it ??????,1
What's going on with supercell I entered the right email and password but verification code still not coming. If anybody know about this problem Please help me to recover my account as soon as possible. Thank you,1
"One of the best multiplayer and single games I've ever played on the phone, really addictive there's always something to be done, get to build your clan and raise your army 💪",5
The game always disconnects even if I had a good network connection it's disturbing.... And in my opinion the loot that we gain on the builder base is so little that attacking 3 attacks per day can't even help me to upgrade some defenses... Hope you'll consider my review,5
"Theres a bug occurring when i edit my village, the walls somehow get stuck and when that happens my screen freeze but the game still functiong, why do y'all still haven't fix that?!",3
My money has been debited twice from my bank account while purchasing gold pass though the payment was failed i didn't recieve and pass or i Didn't get any money back in my account i tried to to contact customer support but no one is responding to my messages.,1
I really enjoy this game. My favorite part is the Builder Base. I wish the Flying Machine from Clash Royale could be added as a troop in either the Main Village or Builder Base someday.,5
Good game. Please include in the shop a feature to change gold or elixa to gems. Im not going to spend real money on this game. Also you should have also made a feature that once you reach town hall 12 you get a certain amount of gems,3
I've been playing since the begining and always enjoyed the game. I've left a time or two but I always come back. The longevity of the game is high level.,5
"Very bad game, all the time when I am opening the game blank screen comes even I have allow all the permissions.And also the contact to developer but they are not helping. They told me that contact from game and etc etc but not helping me.",1
"This game is very enjoyable to play. There is a problem, though. Every time the game updates, it becomes impossible to play at all. You open the app, and it immediately shuts down. Currently, I cannot play this game at all. It takes at least a day or two to have the problem corrected.",2
I really like this game me and my mates play all the time it's really fun but one thing I don't like is how you have to wait 4 years to upgrade your campfire or send 1000 gems to skip it,4
Get rid of the jumping through hoops after updates and the letting you know how many people are online and bring back global then it'll be a real 5 ⭐ right now wish I give 4.5 if you'll really wanna be awesome SUPERCELL give TH9 something new and useful a troop that 10s get spaces spell something,5
Awesome game easy to play and very entertaining. Played for years now and still love it. Perhaps if you make another use for gems after you have gotten all of your builders huts? Great game supercell 👍,5
I've been trying for 2 days to get back into my game and it keeps crashing 2 seconds into it. I've tried contacting me supercell and I get nothing from them but pre-responsed emails,1
I have to start the game three time. On third tey is opens otherwise it stay on loading page only. Quickly fix this issue supercell.,3
It's good for now but too much to do over there makes it look hard to come to when u wanna play the game.. this makes u want to play buh u can't play when u wanna. U feel u need a special time to play,3
"Playing Video games has been one of my major hobbies and this Game gave me everything whatever I need as a person like patience, Thinker and strategic planning and good analytical thinking. it is the best game i have came accross.",5
"I'm at town hall 9 (About to be 10 once it upgrades) and this game is great. It is a totally time waster with NO ads! Great game, 5 stars.",5
"This is a fantastic game, I've been playing this from my childhood and I love playing it. It helps us in following ways: 1.Improves IQ 2.Co-ordination 3.Enhances the fast decision making ability 4.Competition 5.Improves patience",5
This game is great but the problem is when we attack there must be no time... I hope you guy can fix it try to remove time attack👍👍👍,5
Recently I don't know why they blocked my ID..now I m try to get in touch with team but the customer service is poor..not getting satisfied answer and only the chat bot who is helping there is no any live person who can talk nd explain what's going on,1
"Really great game been playing this game for half a decade and it's still amazing.The devs are really responsive, lost my old account and the support team help me recover it in a matter of 3 days.",5
"It's really nice & excellent game if network issue will be ignored. By the way, sometimes it crashes 😑",2
"This game is amazing but the problem is, when you reach the higher levels everything will takes a lot of time to upgrade (even days!)",4
"Clash of clans is a game where you need to use your really smart brain 🧠 👌,and is fun because you 😀 can make your village how ever you want as long as you have the right amount of either coins,elixir,or gems!",5
"Hey community, The game is very good but just one thing please bring the old sounds back because of that I turn the volume of while playing so please bring them back. If they are back then this game is 5 stars from me",4
"Best game .. It has been 9 yrs since I am playing the game...... still playing.. I think, it would be better if we could forge capital gold without builders (while forging resources).",5
Worst game. After the Update i cant Open the Game it always Stuck at Loading Screen i have reinstall the game for more than 3 times. But it Did not Work. Hereby i am requesting to fix This problem,1
"Wifi lag problem when you enter this game,why tho its pretty good before the ice king update if i'm not mistaken,the game was the one that lags,i can make sure my wifi is good,i even can open youtube and other games smoothly,pelase fix this thx",5
it's good to play but I can't get back my old accounts because of the sepercell id but the quality of the apps is okay I hope they fix it when they get the account back and where can I get the unlock code,4
It is a fun action packed game. You can chill with friends in your clan whilst attacking and raiding other towns. It is a great strategy game.,4
Slow upgrades to the game. Builder camp is way over due on expansion and upgrades not worth doing anything in that camp.,2
I really like the game it's fun but can you make the clan treasury take the loot that they only want because when I get loot from the treasury every loot gets in my storage and I'm only using the gold so when a attacker attack my loot will be taken and there's also a bug I think I cannot but a builders base elixer on the trades guy with raid medel,5
In my phone's when I was opening coc then showing on my phone screen SUPERCELL after this the whole screen was turn into black color ⚫ and game was not responding.,3
A lot of bugs as when I open the app screen doesn't load sometimes but otherwise it's the best n most enjoyable strategy game.,4
"The game is good and everything, but I wish you would bring back the global chat cuz sometimes it gets boring when other clanmates aren't active and you have no one to talk to and play etc.",3
Have upgraded and lost village wall configuration and have and most defence icons. Likev strating all over. Very disappointing.,2
"Good game but please increase the storage for magical items, it only hold one book and one hammer that is not enough for us , time to time i was forced to sell them just because of the low storage thing.",1
Very fun game but this last update just makes the game not as fun because you dont have to get a certain amount of elixir to train your troops so any base that has very low amounts of elixir just gets attacked because of no troop training cost,3
"The attacks are over powered, you upgrade your defenses just to have a spell dropped from the sky to obliterate everything, almost makes it pointless to spend so much time and money upgrading things",2
"Been playing since a year after release. Always the authentic clash experience, I have nothing negative to say and I feel it has a strong future ahead of it.",5
"The game is good, i recommend to everyone who want a strategic game. My only concern is can you add the contribution info in CLAN CAPITAL like the contributor > amount contributed > and which building did he contributed it so the leader know who is responsible on rushing the base. Thank you",5
Hey this is a 5 star game but the only issue I have rn is I just uninstalled and installed again I've done this for a couple updates where if I click on the game it takes me back to my home screen it's a weird glitch,5
Oh I really like this game but I don't know is it a bug or not.clan game is started at night but I fall asleep and the next morning I check.most of my clan members are already finished so I also want to do clan games but it says 'many members of your clans are taked part'or something like that.so I could do any clan games mission and I didn't get any rewards.pleade fix that.,4
After the last update app is not working please look in to it and find out what is the issue because I love to play COC but now I'm unable to play the game because app is getting closer automatically.,1
"I love the game but theres only one thing i dont like, the versus battle match making!!! Im only bh 6 and going agains bh 6 - 7 and its pretty rare for me to find a save lvl bh to fight agains. Pls fix this thanks",3
Please help me im playing this game for 6 months and now i got a new phone its vivoy91c i can't open coc. Plss fix it says incompatible i really need it to be fix its my only game(except clash royale) EDIT:THANK YOU supercell for hearing my wish it's working now since the capital district update big thankyou for you,5
"This game is great but there's a glitch and it may damage the game, Hope the Developers fix this problem.",3
"After some time I decided to redownload the game and even tho it took me a couple hours I managed to gain access to my old account, great game just takes a lot of time to upgrade now",4
Been playing this game on and off for 10 years. You always come back to it lol. Love it and it's the only app I don't mind spending a few pound on every month or sometimes every other month.,4
"It is of course a great one but the free troop training update, I think it will make game easier and you don't need to grind but that's is not a nice one , before it it was good👍",3
"Extremely addictive. Lots of things to do. But, I am afraid of one thing, when it needs multimillion resource, it will take extreme effort!!",5
"COC is an awesome game overall, that being said; it gets a bit too old. And updates don't feel that new at the moment. I docked a star off because hackers and trolls are rampant; my clan was harassed by trolls with chinese looking names spaming our chat while entering and leaving which made alot of members leave. hopefully this is fixed. UPDATE: Needs more players.",4
"I came back after about 5 years just in time for the zero army train cost update, and I must say I'm having fun being able to attack any base without worrying about cost efficiency.",5
"great game, always something to do and improve , hard to put game down, thought that had lost game but got it back. make sure you back it up!",5
This game is awesome for me because there is not any network issue not very addictive game I am playing this game for 3 years but I can't see in this game there is problem because this is non addict game Disadvantages of this game was that it take more time to upgrade this is the only one problem that see I this game,5
Was a 5 star but with new update crashes all the time and can't stay active daily due to constant crashing in the middle of battles....not cool,3
"It is a very god play. All is good. The buildtime is very compatible. I think, that the only Problem is there are Not friendship between Clans. All are Enimies.",4
"This game according to me is optimistic and fantastic, i am playing this game till 4years ago now i am on 13townhall but this game their is a bit problem That i and everyone faces that is the black screen and hang also while attacking.i requested to clash of clans authorities to solve this problem as soon as possible",5
"It's so fun to battle people,farm,make clans,and upgrade. So pretty much everything in the game clash of clans. I hope this informed you enough to get you to try it yourself.",5
"after recent update, app kept crashing after i atk once in builder base. clearing cache & restarting & reinstalling didn`t fix it, i can`t play at all now 🤬",1
"Hey, I am playing this game from approximately 10 years... This is the best game... I have one request that please reduce upgradation timing of troops and buildings. 🙏🙏",5
"Very good game and very original, I love that in the new update you can train troops with no cost it saves me alot, thank you supercell for making a enjoyable game and I wish you luck with any new games.",5
"this is the best game ever. People complain about long wait time, however, if there were not long upgrades everybody would become maxed way too fast.",5
I think this game is great if you want to burn time and especially if you have been playing it for years it gets fun once you get to the high town halls building you base um currently town hall 4 but I still am grinding its really fun also if you have other freinds or family that has built a big clan my whole family has been playing for years and its fun to be in the clan 5/5 would recommend,1
Here's a question. Why do I always find th11 opponents in multiplayer battles? I'm just a th10. And why does th10 opponents only give 4-8trophy's? Are you crazy? If you fix this than maybe I'll rate it with 4-5 stars,1
"love this game so addictive jss wish they would nerf the waiting time for some of the buildings but its still worth it the game is amazing it like no other game special in it own way ""supercell"" should be proud going back to the waiting time definitely puts strain on the players to spend money now i mean most developers these days do it on purpose but ive played 100 rpg games and non of those waiting times have been nearly as long as this game but everything else i cant complain about nice job",5
Love the game. Unable to play due to continuous crashes which happened after the latest update. Please advise.,1
This game awesome. It has been more than 6 years of clashing in coc. Loved it alot. ❤️🔥👍🏻👍🏻. But things are getting very easier in new updates people aren't grinding like earlier.,5
"This game is good, challenging, and fun. It is nice and fun that I downloaded this game. The more you upgrade your town hall, the more challenging the game...",5
I have played this game for the past 7 years it's a really nice game but the only problem is upgrading time which is super annoying.,4
past 2 days I have face some issue i don't know how but I have deployed all my army in field but One trop are alwayswaiting or not deployed why I have lost my matches again and again with other players please fix this issue as soon as possible otherwise I will delete this game and uninstall Permanently,1
"The best mobile game but it has too much censorship (-3 stars) and wokeness (-1). Free speech, Supercell... get with the program. It's just not as fun without edgy jokes and hate speech",1
The new update is so good because you don't have to spend many elixirs to train troops And you can upgrade a level 5 wall using elixirs and its been years since i didn't play this game and all of my buildings is max even my troops. Urghh i love it 😘💕 thanks supercell,5
"Might take a look on the builder base bcoz u only need to win in order to get elixer but the problem is the more you win the higher the trophy is, and the problem you may face higher builder base",4
"Not able to open game after new update (07/02/2022). Crashes without even loading anything. Tried clearing dache and data, did not help",1
The game is good every thing is perfect but the time building takes is so much. Please SUPERCELL make it little less time for building,4
I does not like this game it have lot of updates for bug fixes but there is no update for recover your account if it is connected to supercell id then we can't change the email also so i hate it make a update for recover accounts🤔,1
"Very nice game, I am still playing 12 years but i haven't bored, but the deffects in this game are the game has start and cuz of glitch it close. So i am requesting to supercell to fix these silly problems",5
"It's really messed me up why there is no notification for research upgrade, I missed a lot of research potion because of it, please consider to add that feature!!!!!!!",3
"It is a good game but they need to add some more features like one clan person can donate any thing like gold, elixers whom ever need to them to the other persons can donate and also walls, heros updation cost should be reduced we need this all then only it will be some what good game and also every day in daily deals there should be run of dark elixer, run of gold and run of elixer and also heros updation book and builder updation book should be added then it will be very good game",3
"after the update,everything got better,this update is just amazing,because of the free cost of training,I began to play the game more often than before,I really like this update,so please devs ,dont remove the update and keep updating your game.",5
"The waste update, I lost interest in this game because of this update. Training troops at free? It become just like other games. I didn't expected this from this game.",1
Been playing for years (max builder base and th 14 level V) and when I switched from iphone to android I couldnt access my account so I reached out to support and they helped me get my account back! Supercell is great.,5
"Excellent I loved this game from the start, it's the best in the world I Love It, but it takes too much gems to buy a builder Hope you could reduce that, but I love it",5
Clash of Clans is a great game but it take some time to grow and when you get higher it will be harder sometimes it will be 1 or 2 higher than you current townhall can you fix the matching sytem like current townhall of you will be 60% and 1plus be 30% and 10%under level so it will be fair because its hard to find ay opponent,3
"Been loyal to the game for years. Hope CoC never goes away and runs just as long as the One Piece anime series or Runescape lol. But upgrades could be shortened and gem costs. 5year and over Veterans should get discounts, sponsor offers or something.",5
Great game . But must include the builder potion in the raid medal shop . It takes half a month to upgrade stuff and including the builder potion in the raid medal shop at least give us a lite hope,4
"i wanna like this patch but ever since the update, i can't log in to my account anymore. the app kept crashing and sending me back to the menu. devs, please fix",1
Worst game nowadays..Hackers try to steal accounts through phishing at help support by giving details of account and change names of the account. I tried to recover my account which was townhall 11 (max) through help support then they banned my another account of townhall 12 for 31 days. Just want to say that your progress in game is not permanent as anyone could steal your account. Want supercell to look into the matter. I was a super fan of coc but they just ruined my feelings towards the game,1
Very good game it is amazing. There is many things you can do while playing I recommend finding a nice clan to join. but it gets very grindy later but is still fun.,5
I never liked strategy games but when I played this game I couldn't resist. it was so addictive and later when I came to know that I can also play this with my friends it became my favourite.,5
I have a request. Can we get builder hall 10 please. I feel like the builder hall has been slept on for awhile. I wanna do more there once I max it out. Other than that great game. Love it to death.,5
"Upgrade time is very long which makes the game boaring 🙁, It is very hard to max the base , it will take approx 3-4 years to max your base which is very boaring.",1
"Amazing, I haven't played in about 2 years and I just got back on and my village didn't recognize me and did I was a disguised goblin lol it was a pretty fun welcome party. Thank you supercell for adding the small details. 5/5",5
I really like playing this game specially with my besties but somtimes i get bored becoz i have to wait very long to upgrade things or to train troops..... There's no other problem in this game 4 meh . Be patient wen u play this game 🤣 otherwise u will loose alot of gems 🤧😂😂,4
It is the best video game in the world. I love this game . I always use game to play. I like Queen more.But need some changes!!! Sometimes lag!,5
I have been playing this game for awhile now and I entirely love the game because the developers take time into their game and make it great. There us always great and exciting updates so yes Clash of Clans deserves a 5 star rating.,5
I would have given 6 stars bcoz now no need to spend elixir to prepare army this is best update.People like me who play less due to work can now actually earn a lot of resources with few attcaks due to not spending elixir on army.Keep this the way it is and i think i can continue to play it.,5
"Really Really cool game, Can you please the next update make upgrading and building time reduced by just 10%? bc its really really complicated to wait 2 days just to build 1 structure, then freakin lvl 100 players attack you with no ease",5
My game is not working properly. When I start my game it didn't reload and the screen turns black. I am soo much irritated by this . So please do something in this.,1
Very good game but you would require a lot of patience as it takes a lot of time to upgrade things and train army and other stuff,5
"What the Amazing game, but it takes much days to upgrade buildings: 15-18 days. OMG it's really crazily, please it should be about 10 days instead of it, but it's jus amazing! good luck to ceators! thanks",5
😍😍😍😍😍 the clash of clans should add a feature that we can temporarily disable our coc account and no attack should be there while we are not playing the game for one or two months as much a player wants to be disabled by the way game is much better than other strategy games supercell love your games especially coc and cr,5
"I just wanted to request a feature in the next coming update which is to add personal chat option with added friends. I'd be grateful if this idea gets acknowledged , thank you",5
The game is really fun because I have fun playing it because you can like battle and stuff and like when you level up your things it's like really cool watching it and stuff so keep this game going please,5
"Been playing for 4 years, Really Wonderful, worth a game for time pass, hope it still goes on better with new updates like the recent clan capital-""I enjoyed it"". Tysm for a Marvellous Game❤✨",5
Clash Of Clans is the best game that i've ever played or seen... Easy rating would be 5 stars. One major issue is army training time... Please make it less or make it no time training.,5
Overall great app and fun experience the only thing I do not like is having to wait from minutes to days to upgrade troops and buildings.,4
"Dear coc Team, I have not been able to play the game since I gave the game update. Having autoback problem. Please fix my problem as soon as possible.",1
This is the best game on my dady's cp and good graphics but I hope the upgrade will speed up due to the duration of the upgrade because papa brings this cellphone so sometimes I can't upgrade other troops and structures so I'm sorry,2
This Game is OUTSTANDING! 🔥But I'm giving 4 Stars b'coz of they Reason which I Wrote ahead. The Supercell Team pls make concern of this review : Your Team should Decrease the Amount of BUILDER GOLD and BUILDER ELIXIR to Upgrade the Walls in BUILDER BASE it's very Hard to Max BUILDER BASE WALLS. It takes so much Time.,4
"It's an awesome game but its troop training time is so disgusting.I want to say of the game owner that,plz decrise the train time 4x . untill this is so big time for training.If you decrise training time it will good for every gamer . please.",5
"This is an interesting game and it has lots of fun but , in the starting it takes to many diomands and there should be new character with new map with every update",4
Game is great when players are active in clan. Strategy is very complex. Sadly the mini game they added was so poorly made I can't bring myself to give a better rating.,3
For Halloween can you put a frankenstine skin for the king. Btw very good game never getting bored of it but something that most people want clash of clans to fix is the revenge button make it a way that we know the player is available to revenge.,4
I like clash of clans there is no really a problem in the game but i think it's still better if you bring the global chat because its hard to invite players that you don't even know if they are really active in the war and other events at least in the global chat you know that they are active because they are online and you don't have to worry about looking into the list players that you can invite plus the play time of players will be longer they can just talk to global chat and wait till train,5
Most troops have super troopes but electro dragon have not super electro dragon in new update add one more super electro dragon he is very amazing troop super electro dragon and less the training time in home village and shield problems please fix it I play the game 3 year and make strong power full weapon in tw 15 update thankful to this favor,4
"After the recent update, the game keeps crashing, a lot of the times during an attack.",3
Hey! Can u fix the crash system because when i attack at the night village it crash and if i rejoin i try to get out and getting crashed im stuck at it ty!,5
The game is great especially when you apply your strategy skills in battle as well as in designing your base to defend attackers.,5
"best farming kingdom game ive seen so far, with logical ways to get gems without top-up, i regret i didnt start playing it from the first time i heard about it (around 8 years ago from my classmate)",5
Game will not send code. 3 days after restoring my phone and the game will not send me the authentication code. It is not in my spam or junk or any other folder. No help from support.,1
"It's a good game, I can spend my time taking care of my Village and the Clan Capital is pretty nice! I love to make the raids and build with my clanmates our Valleys and Capital Perk, as a team. Good job Supercell!",5
"Playing this game since the good old days of 2014. Supercell has done a great job of updating and keeping the players engaged. Just got a Samsung Tab S8 Ultra 12.4"" 120hz tablet and I'm all set!",5
"On and off for some years now, but overall it's good. Probably one of the most top tier mobile games going. Might as well give it ago, over 500Million have.",4
Some may love it and some may hate it...but we all agree that its one of the G.O.A.T game ever made...Its been many years still there are many wonders yet to be discovered..,5
"The experience is good. I really enjoys it. But the problem and injustice is, a clan gets 10 extra stars who wins the last round in CWL event. That's isn't good.",5
It's a very very very nice game a only thing thats disturbing that it takes lot of upgrade time means lots of upgrades time like 2 days 11 days 4 days .that why I gave 4 stars .but overall game is good,4
"Awesome Passtime. Stimulates your mind and passes time wonderfully! Player for 3 Years now. Enjoyable pastime. Thanks for working out the Patches to the June update so quickly, I only lost a day of Battles.",5
I've been playing for years and I like this game.. but their is this problem that i always get disconnected for no reason when i click the attack icon especially on clan capital and sadly it appears that i had used my attack already..please fix this problem.,5
The taget priority and target choosing of the units is mostly laughable and full of bugs..thats why I stoped playing for the past 4 years. To my surprise the issues still remain,1
Upgrade timing for trops and building are too high... siriously it's boring 🥱 developers should focus on this to reduce time.,2
I like the game been playing the game for a while but I wish there was an option were you don't have to be attacked followed with you not being able to attack others if its on the Sheilds are dumb in my opinion but other than that good game 5 stars 🌟,5
"I'm old player,Clash Of Clan I've been a player for a long time, but I'm happy every time I play hero free But now I feel like something has changed Clash Of Clan I'm always encouraged because I have been playing since I was young and I really like it.",5
Hi coc I wish you read my comment I give this game five star but can I suggest a new game that look like clash of clans but no one was make it like a civilization you can grow and make a country by inavading enemy and researching weapons reaserching supply/resources and upgrading your defense army and much more and when the first start of the game you will claim a little amount of land like role playing game as a king or a leader I have much more idea about a game I hope you read this comment 🥰,5
Game is okay.. But it gives me anxity . It is addictive for no reason. Updates are too long.. You need to waste your time in order to collect the loot.,1
Bring back the national flags. They didn't get bought by many player but it is an og thing about the game. And if they do come back please add more country's.,3
It's good👍 Verygood👌 So good The game my favorite part is upgrading and raiding thats why i love clash of clans and im always watching coc vlogs like klaus and beak and clash bashing best gemmer for me And itzu im watching him to.. The best part of clash is everything yup everything 💯% he😅. I love clash❤️ im goinh to finish it all cost you know cost i dong want to finish town hall.. I haven't try the mega troop i want mega troops i definitely want the super wall breaker. This is theuntafable,5
Played game from beginning. Think they're in jump the shark mode now. Most didn't like builder base so they created an expansion that feels like builder base but longer. Guess get rich and screw it after that?,2
"Great game but ever since the last update all it does for me is crash, won't even load up anymore. I've played it for years which is sad.",4
Greatest game! I just find it annoying when the enemy village just gives 1-9 trophies please fix this.,5
Great game just takes awhile to level up in the higher ranks but overall very good game my wife and I play every day and battle each other to sharpen our skills and to test our strengths,5
"I don't like Supercel-ID's security system, I lost my account because it was hijacked, after I contacted Supercell for help, but Supercell couldn't help me!",1
This game is very good and non addictive but after the June update my one of the supercell village got freeze and shut down... This is happening continuously.. plzz fix this as I had done my village to th11....,2
"I play this game for 4 years and I got best experience, quality,no bugs and any software error . Very good app.",5
"I have 997 gems. I saved it to buy another builder which costs 1k gems. I bought a potion through raid medals and sell it for 10 gems but the gem don't add up, instead it became 500 which is more than half has been wasted. I was disappointed.",2
After clan captial update. Game play automatically stuck and black screen will appear.i can't play smooth and well.please fix the issue.Andriod version 9,5
"Great game, lots of strategy. I love the new upgrades. The Clan Capital seems to really have revived interest in the game. Keep up the good work!",5
"Disgusting services. It show network error, I am using WiFi and other apps run properly but clash of clan shows network error.",1
Its a great game. Each character is simply charming and humorish. But it also lets you create your own base. Anything else is fine.,5
"This is a wonderfull game,But it takes very long time to upgrade building after town hall 9 it started getting more time to upgrade things.So please reduce the time",3
Very fun and very good and addictive and I lust love it and actually my brother introduced me to it and ever since then I've just been loveing it but it's very time consuming but it's just the best game on my phone that I have it deserves the five stars,5
Very nice game but the only one I noticed are every scenery and skins of hero are all limited edition! Why did it resale again. For players who want it back and buy!!,5
Game is ehh.. has ups and downs do enjoy playing it but support is a pain to get to and dont think id spend anymore money on a game that doesn't care about the people that play it just remember they here to make money and care about nothing else,2
it's super pay to win but amazing game nonetheless just needs alot of dedication and patience to get things and it's basically the best game to keep on your phone and check back on it every now and then :),5
I have performance problem with my device. Everytime I play the game it lags a lot. Edit: It's now working properly. Thanks,5
It's a great game but I can't register my account in supercell I don't know why the register button is not in there pls fix this even though it's still a game you don't want to install just pls fix that and I will rate it 5 star,4
"About supercell id,Because i press the wrong gmail and i thought that i could change the gmail through supercell id but it didn't go properly so i convince my cousin if i can disconnect the supercell to the gmail account and he says that if you delete all data then your account will also be deleted to all supercell games and i am thinking if i could fix this through website and i search it many times but in the end i couldn't do it so i hope that you can fix the supercell id to be able to dc acc",1
One thing I don't like it's you made it super difficult to we'll swap between accounts so I lost villages and now you have to have a level 2 to get into the clan stuff if you're getting ridiculous you got nobody that wants to play and your friend anymore cuz everybody quit that makes it hard and you made it difficult to recruit for the clan anymore wonder why I don't play as much,5
This game is fun you will learn how to make strategy and it will take patience to build your village and to make stronger base and it will take scound minutes hour's days to be a strong village and when you start playing TH 1 is kind an cute base actually hahaha that's all thanks.,5
"Pretty good game to play in my free time, but the only thing that quite bothers me is the upgrade time, like seriously, almost a month to upgrade 1 building? well dam..",4
Amazing game over all but the one problem I have is the builders. It's so hard to get the others and even you have the 500 gems it multiplies by 2 Wich is really anouing.,5
"Ever since this new update, the game keeps crashing. It's become so unstable that it's almost unplayable.",1
I think i didn't need a TH14 update. Now i have to play for longer time to max out my account. I personally don't like strategy games but i also hate to leave this midway.,4
"I am play coc almost 7 years but this time coc apps useing several problem facing,my phone crush,everytime that use this app,very bad for coc , because several coc user off playing coc for apps performance very low and crushing phone that reason,I play free fire but not facing any problem but only coc use my phone hangout,curesd cerud many problem I hope coc fix all very first and we played our lovely game smoothly I pray that plz coc fix I'd first.........।",1
I like this game this is very much fun. But they have a problem the problem is you update something that take vary much time. That's why somewhere clash of clans is boring.,5
"Hey,love you're game but it is constantly crashing for no reason and it keeps crashing j was in the middle of an attack and it just crashed so please fix it",4
"The best game I've ever played. But to get gems is very hard, they can improve it by making a gem investment or something. I just wanna talk with a creator, pls reply",4
"I can't open my clash of clans, it always auto kick me in the game. Even when I was in the loading screen the game will crashed and I can't play the game.",1
I have been given 4* before now it is 5*! the best game ever! but there were best features lost like global chat please back it! and the new capital hell brings another joy! keep it up!,5
"I rated this game a 2 star cause they don't have a system that connects to google play games..My account lost when they deleted the google play games account, my account didn't have time to connect it to super cell.. Pls bring back the system that connects to google play games...",2
"This is a nice game with nice graphics and features, its impossible how far it has gotten after it's history, but look at it now, I've loved this game since i got it a year ago",5
I really like this game and it so fun but i gave 4 stars becuase everything takes a lot of time to upgrade and builders hut is so expensive thats why i gave 4 stars overall everything is very fun like getting new cards like pekka and dragon and more fun cards this game is very fun to play,4
"I used to love this game. But easy elixer, gold have made this game a boring one and also training troops now need no elixer, made matters worse. I am always full with gold and elixer eventhough i don't go to wars.There is no point in playing this game",2
"Very fun and lots to explore while you battle, upgrade and hang out with your friends. Definitely recommend",5
It is good game but please seperate each each wall in builder base but it is a nice game the season are very good reduce the updete time for little bit,5
"I really like this game, I just wish you could battle with or against your friends like how you can in clash royale. Overall this is a great game and very addictive.",4
"It's a really good game, but i gave it 4 stars because there are a lot of bugs for a lot of things and my screen turns black.",4
Unable to play since the latest update. Crashes on launch consistently and there is nothing I can do to prevent it.,1
This game is so fun there are no glitches no mess ups no bugs this game is all about strategy and skill but along the way it gets much easier and more fun I recommend playing this game!!!,5
No doubt game is awesome But little bit want change Number one change in loots searching if I choose base for loots and I'm starting there applying troops for loots but mistakenly I press key of next searching base Wish there one option for reverse base option which I lift mistakenly,5
The game is good.but there is problem. when we tries to open the game it won't respond it just show a black screen.,1
"It helps in creativity leadership and learning to cope with life problems,it is a fun game, not only the attacking and fighting but the development and growth of your village.",5
It can get to pay to win if you let it but you can still get to the same power as people who have spent hundreds on the game with nothing but hard work dedacation and time a lot of time,5
It's a great game. It is really fun to battle and upgrade your village. Clan capital is now my favorite thing. If you like casual games this game is for you.,4
"This is a fantastic game and keeps me invested, however i am having trouble with raid attacks that are shown wrong and also some of my builder boost potions dissapeared without me using them.",3
Whenever i click this game it took 1 minute and then got bug and then crashed. Every time it's happend. Is there any solutions to play this game peacefully,1
"I love this game, and I have two clans now. I hope i have a max th🥀😭 but im still processing on it. Please adjust the processing time upgrade of the building❤️ i really love this game ❤️❤️",5
"realyfun , like the cool buildings may take a long time to upgrade. at the end of the game most thing are overpriced",4
"One of the best online mobile game ever! Supercell is SUPERB at taking feedbacks from their community, and creating new content and updates most players will enjoy, which I believe is why the game has been going for ten years strong!",5
Enjoying the game.... But when i change my account then it is hard for me to enter the game...now also i tryd hard for enter the game but i cant😥😥😥.pls fix this problem,5
"Its a good game, some of the stuff just take a while to upgrade and it's hard to buy more builders.",4
Game is awesome ... Bt there is A big issue in upgrading... Its take too much time to upgrade... It takes 15 to 20 days ... So the progress is very slow due to upgradind,4
I think there should be an store upgrade section like if all builders are busy and i want to upgrade another buildind but don't wanna spend gems so i put that building in store upgrade sec. that build is complte the builder would strat that build that i have store immediatly without my order so if i put that upgrade at night and the build completes in mid night so the next build will start btw the game is best,5
"The game was good,and having fun play with friends.But we can't change the clan name,once we set.Plz I want to change clan name.My clan was good but I have make one spelling mistakes in middle.I just want to make correction.",2
Game is good but only one suggestion...Please either decrease the upgrade time of troops or at least increase the number of laboratory...Its so time taking to wait for troops to get upgraded for 10-13 days,5
This is the best game but i rated it 2 because of the problem that iam facing Is when I try to change village or go for attack or trying to visit some one base then it sudden turn into black screen My device is Redmi Y2 Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 14 nm octa core processor 3 gb ram 32 gb storage @ coc please help me to solve this problem,2
Game is crashing after update release.. When we scouting war base or switching Accounts.. Solved this issue.. there's no new Achievements for Earn Gems,1
Ive had majormfun playing this and its very fun it just gets a tiny bit annoying whenever upgrades take up to 6 hours but other than that its amazing,5
"I hate to ruin a very old rating like Old Old from 2019 but free troops? Too much. It's nice the prices has been WAY LOWERED but atleast make it cost something like, E.G 1k elixer for baby dragon when in the past, it's was MORE EXPENSIVE",4
"Very very very nice game.. I like you Supercell so much . And it's graphics is so nice. I have been playing this game for 5 years . Now , in present my town hall level is 12 and 5 stars and level is 207",5
"Supercell, why is it my coc account can't be open? It say's that new version is available even though I already update coc. Pls fix it , I've been playing this since I was grade 7. I don't want to lose that account.",5
A very nice game where we can become king/Chief and do attacks. Overall a nice game. Everyone should try it..,5
This is a nice game I reached town hall level 10 but I have lost every thing since the update so please fix it it took me a month to reach town hall level 10 please help me please ok so I am playing again and I was level 8 and boom I lost every thing again I lost 2 accounts I now hate this game,3
"this game is great its better than all the other games I have. it's really cool how you need to build a base but attack for stuff"" and the first time me playing I new I was going to like this game",5
I am an OG player and I have experience several updates in the game that have blown up my mind. And it's the game which will stay for decades. Thanks COC.,5
"Been playing for a few years, great game, takes a while to upgrade stuff, other than that it's great.",5
Really good game real strategy needed and skillful mind only thing I really don't like is the upgrade timers some seem a little ridiculous while others I can see why they take so long.,4
"""Congragulations"" @SUPERCELL . Happy 10th ClashAnnivensery. Best Game Ever. I start playing on brothers mobile since year2016-2020.I left the game and started another games. In year 2021 I START PLAYING AGAIN. AND I'm playing and enjoying clash of clans at the time.",5
Good graphics but keeps crashing I'm th 12 and it's really annoying getting kicked back to loading screen everytime you enter clan capital district one star until fixed,1
I'm giving this game two star because I deleted this game for my exams and I forgot my gmail so I reported coc and it asks so many questions abot my village I answered it properly but it's showing Im unable to find your account ? Then I have no option what should I do iwas at th9 it was so hard to get on that level so I had no option I uninstalled this game so I hope supercell will fix this issue,2
"Since the new update, the game keeps lagging and crashing. I can't play this game properly anymore. Pls fix this issue.",2
The best game i have ever experienced especially after i learned how to attack i dont have any problems in the game and i love this game since the last update (HIGHLY RECOMMEND),5
I think this is the best game ive ever played but there is a catch that insted of making the troops zero cost make it so that you have to pay less to upgrade the troops camp,5
I had been playing clash of clans from 6 years..i really love this game...bt now m facing issue..game gets crash in between while attacking for seconds plz fix this issue asap,1
Godd game.but trophy system never seems to work out in your favour.I consistently lose 20 to 30 trophy every time I get attacked and on average I only get 13 to 25 trophies per 2 attacks,3
"Interesting, but due to the new update, it's taking up much phone space, and is running slow. Couldn't even Update, and Play",1
After the june update coc is not responding at all...i could just open it for one time and then it just crashed..and since then i am unable to open it anymore.. Please fix it soon..,2
It is a very good game I ever seen in my life after PUBG. It is so fun playing clash of clans and plus I love the animation the characters and everything.I wish I could mate the person who made it,4
The improvements have made the game more enjoyable. I like that you can have two bases and there are more options to be rewarded with gems you do not have to pay for.,5
I love this game its a classic and always fun to play and I love the use of gems to speed things up and buy things like potions and skins it's such a cool game and I think you shouldnplay it!,5
"The game is fun, however for an advantage you have to spend money. So basically the user with the larger wallet gets the better experience.",2
Very entertaining but the only irritating thing is that the troops most of the time target the wrong objective and there's no way we're we can change their target,4
Unable to verify login verification. And it's been so long. The dev team didn't fix about it. I think they planning to removed it in playstore.,1
This is a really fun and exciting game.its definitely something to do in your spare time.and the reason for why I didn't rate this five star is because it kept asking me to rate clans but the game is really fun try it.,4
"I've been trying to play this game for years now.. But it keeps crashing.. I dont know why, but for some reason the game works now.. All in all its a great game.",5
Ohhh my Goodness I love this game I really do appreciate it this is a compliment that I've never played one game for more than two months but this game almost a year..... but the training time is somehow long so if u guys can do something I'll like it,5
Supercell iam describing one of the biggest issue you ever had plzz fix the problem of OTP not coming to Gmail because of this issue many players even I am not getting my old I'd back. I GAVE YOU THREE STAR RATING NECAUSE I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH please fix the OTP problem then I will give you 5 STAR RATING,3
"Pls fix the bug in opening of the game, i can't play the game because it automatically restart and restart even my internet service is good. Pls fix this asap",1
"After downloading this game for the first time after some waiting... I couldn't log-in the game it would say "" login failed try again later "".Then I came back tomorrow it still said "" failed to login "" [ PLS FIX THIS ]",1
"Nice game, since I'm young i always playing this game. But the clan wars league are so confusing, the defender have th 9 then the attacker just th 5,6. I love the game but the cwl is not balanced.",4
I played this game from last 6 years. But i stopped to playing this game 1 year ago because of my exams. But today i again install it . But i can't log in in my old account. Please help me to recover the account.,3
Fun but issues with the Google play cards trying to redeem them. I have lost 3 cards with nothing in return for them. Game is great.,4
The game is still one of the best games I have played. I used to play this game using my other phone. It was very fun to play. Decided to come back and play again. It has further improved while keeping the classic feeling. Keep up the good work.,5
The game is good but the problem is the game it doesn't have the rocks the town hall the trees and bushes I try reloading the game but it's just the same,3
"Wait a minute, no need to spend loots on training troops and brewing spells or building machines?? Is it a programming mistake or what? Whatever it is, it's awesome!!! 😄",5
"new update app crashes, hey chief i cant play after last update the app crashing after loading and its stuck in night village and freezed, i delete the app and re download still crashing",1
This game is one of the best mobile games out in my opinion if u have a job and very little times to just lay back and have fun clash of clans is for u no matter how long u play it a day u can make so much progress in such little time and it brings so much fun 100 download clash of clans,5
This has been a really fun game for many years. Sadly the buildings take so long to upgrade though.,5
I really like how you guys built the original game CLASH within the modern game Clash Of Clans. I thought tropps would've played it but i just had to tap it and i'm playing it.,5
"5 star game, The only game you can actually play with out spending your life savings. The reason I gave Clash of Clans a 5 star rating is SUPER CELL , If there a problem it gets fixed ASAP. Happy anniversary clash of clans",5
As an Old Returning player I really love how much its improved I wish I could have been here for every Anniversary and Update The only Problem for me is I need more Builders Wish I could get At least 1 More cuz that will speed up building alot more,5
Great game the only problem is after a while it takes more that a week to upgrade virtually anything except walls with cost more that Gass nowadays but over all really fun and would recommend to anyone,4
"It's starting to get boring without the global chat. Players recruitment, chatting with randoms, having fun and it nevers get boring at global, tbh, I think most of the player quitted coz of global chat removal. Pls make global chat comeback. Overall it's a great game. Been playing since 2k13, as an OG player global chat really helps others player to be active........Clan chat ain't that fun.",3
This is very time consuming with the building but it's a really fun game because you get to set your base up in funny ways and more.,5
*Verified Clash of clans leader here ⚕️Medical Man⚕️. One of the best games ever! Master troop dispatch techniques to destroy opponent bases. Base designing/copying to defend against the rest of the clash of clan competition in this epic game app where you and your clan can grow stronger and advance.,5
"this game is doing harder, more days, weeks, months and years to reach more powerful defenses and armies this game is gonna make you enjoy more than enjoyment.",5

Again THANK YOU SO MUCH Super CELL STAFF AND SPECIALLY THE GAME IT SELF for giving me the chance again to play and enjoy this game...

"I've been playing this game for over 5 years now and have absolutely no complaints, you can progress at your own pace and have no obligation to watch ads, such a good little game.",5
"Coc is a wonderful game for children's as well as adults... As per my opinion this game build my childhood so beautiful.. This teaches mee to be patience 😂 Now the new updates are so much interesting, so i recommend everyone to try clash of clan....",5
"Nice new update of this coc, its look most exciting than before, new offers, new events, new Hero's and many more! Good job for this! Keep it up!💪😎💯 I only add a short reviews, it's so nice that after I did uninstall my coc, Im so much gladly that I still recovered it...",5
"It's good at first but after almost a yr of playing it i notice that it gets crashed whenever I open the app, pls help me figure out how to fix this.",3
Since I did the update today clash of clans just stops won't fully open on my Samsung tablet I've had trouble before with updates and clash of clans takes several trys to open but now it opens and just stops.,1
It is Arun game but when ever I tried to open the app when it gets close to loading I get forced to go to the home screen and I've tried restarting my device and uninstalling it so I do not know what to do😐😐,4
Since last update I log on. Screen shows I'm on builder base. That screen is frozen. Go to home base and get booted....just as well I'm not in war!,1
"It is a very good game i have been playing it about 4months its best game i have ever played good graphics good strategy and epic battles game i love it i request any one who wants to play battle games should try this game its ossm it is very good for all like mens ,womens ,gils ,boys,for all it is very good game for all ossm game all should try it its changing.colours of your defence and wa)ls",5
Add extra setting changing clan name 😒😒 And my all friends got 10th anniversary tress but iam not getting 10th anniversary trees why ? I have 6 bases and all days minimum 10 hours play this game but my no one bases have 10th anniversary trees 😑 i am offend If i not getting 10th anniversary trees then i unstall and remove this game and iam not getting Christmas trees also 6 bases i have getting only one base 😑😑😑😤,1
Take the star system away!! The higher percentage should win the battle. I'm tired of hitting 90% with one star and losing to somebody at 50% with 2 stars. It's so dumb!!,3
"Installed latest update, game keeps crashing after loading. Tried a phone emulator on my laptop, same thing keeps happening. Please help me find a solution for this.",4
"The game is so amazing, I've been playing this since six years. It gets more and more fantastic, the updates are good. This game is gonna keep improving and I love it.",5
"Sir your game become too laggy after the update ,I have realme narzo 30 and realme 7i both have 4 gb of ram and helio g95 processor and sd662 processor but it's although laging a lot. And also crashes ... Plz fix this problem and make the game more optimised please..",2
"After downloading update, I can't play it.after 7 years years yes I'm upset. Tried everything. Door not update. It will freeze and kick you off.",2
I love this game the way you make a kingdom join clans and have a great time with friends. I will recommend this games is you battle strategy games.,5
I would have given this game 5 stars but the moment the game lag spikes it restarts your whole clientele instead of finding your raid or war attack which makes you lose everything,4
It would be better if you guys the developers like update the shield this g because sometimes You can forget about the game and do something else very fun game actually it is good cause you got be in the game and guard your village and that,5
It's challenging and fun It uses real time in the fact that there are events and all in one word. Good,5
"Game crashes as soon as I log in after I updated the game. Tried reinstalling and restarting my phone, to no avail.",1
I regret why I update it. Since I updated it I can't open the app ... All i see is loading but it isn't opening at all ... Just resolve this issue ASAP otherwise u are gonna lose your audience....,1
"I like this game👍. In other games we need to play without any achivement but in this game it is not like that. When we understand this game it will make us enjoy with lots of friends by creating your own group of friends together in a same clan enjoying the beautiful of 👑clash of clans👑 world 🌎 . Like I said earlier the game we play without knowledge it's like a coffee☕ without sugar, the better we understand the better it 💞sweets💞 as the we don't sweets ever before.",4
Yuh th game is great but the one problem is when im attacking on multilayer or in versus the th im facing is kinda unfair bcuz its higher than mine same goes to versus mode to... Sooo fix it,3
"I can't continue after giving player tag,account name, account clan name, town hall level in the lost account position can you please fix this bug as fast as possible please .",1
"I was started to play this game two days before . I was facing lots of problems like phone hitting, screen light not open, hanging the phone etc.😭😭😭",3
The game is awesome but it's so annoying when the game give unfairly builder base to attack that's like 2x higher level.,4
"The fact clash of clans has been out a decade and is still going with free updates is crazy to me. I guess it just proves that if you make a decent mobile game that has fair paying options, you'll retain an audience.",4
"This game would be a solid 5 stars if i diddnt crash every time i load in. If you guys fix this, 5 stars. Its an amazong game and very entertaining.",3
If I had to rate it which I had to I would say this game is easy to learn with out a clan most clans are not helpful at all and are never active it might be a me problem or also a u problem do not now just play it try it for yourself.,5
I have been playing the game since 2017 and it just keeps getting better every year. it's a good game in general but l wish l could clear out obstacles all at once😏,4
Worst feature when I attack if the net goes slow and we have deployed our full army than after reconnecting it shows defeat and only 1-2 troops has been deployed,1
Can y'all plzz give us a function where we can exchange golds for elexir and elexir for gold and same with dark elexir. It tough when we reach a certain amount of level where we only have gold related build to upgrade so the elixir always goes to waste,3
Great game very good to play but a problem needs to be fixed I am currently th10 attack th11 and 12 and being attacked by th11 and 12 and lonsing large amounts of trophies I wish that the 10s could get more th10s to attack so the game is more fair,1
This is a nice game. But when I play this game it shows me connection lost. But I use Wi-Fi. But I know my net connection is good. So I can't play this game easily. Do you know how can I solve this problem.,3
Best game ever played. The reason I gave it 4 star is that it take too long to upgrade buildings. I am on th 10 max and it take toooo long to do it.,4
"this game is amazing i have been playing sense i was like 5. But it will not let me in. I used to play just fine on my chromebook Acer Spin 11, but now it just closes.",2
Game is good but after TH10 every defencive building and troops update take s too much time. Proposing a new building Clock tower in Home Village which will give us boost for 30 min/ 10 hours every day.,4
Nice game but requires townhall update ASAP. What to play when u maxed out the defenses and armies. If no update is provided old players will start leaving the game soon.,4
Why i cant login via google. The choices of google account when connecting is not there. I follow the steps of google play games. I login then open coc AGAIN i can't open my old account. I go to faq and i don't understand a thing! I go to contact us. I don't remember my name and id. All i want is to login via Gmail/Google account.,1
There is no way you cant enjoy this game. The people of Supercelll work really hard in developing their games and it surely is worth the while.,5
"Really good but wish we get better deals on builder options and gems, need to fix servers lagging out since started new updates your making the game worse quit adding so much so fast control your servers this has been dogshit servers since maintenance fix it dont make it worse pathetic you ask me",2
"The current update is good but it can be better when we upgraded anything, it takes a lot of time, it should not happen if it is exlayer, then it should be upgraded directly, no time",5
I personally love this game This game is a 💣 bomb I really like it But the only thing that needs to be changed is the amount of builders and the longer we wait for an upgrade,5
The newest update is good and all but just one simple problem. Training troops doesn't cost any money so it just makes the elixir less functional...,3
This game is just the best. The action packed things you can do in it is so cool and the buildings you can build is just unimaginable.,5
"Such a fun game, I have a request though, pls make the upgrade for the walls less expensive, because to upgrade a lvl 7 wall to lvl 8 it cost 100,000 gold/elixir, so pls lower the cost for wall upgrades",4
After update game open for 10-15 seconds and then it close. I have downloaded it two times after this problem and this is happening again and again,3
Server lost. Please check your Internet connection. My Internet is nothing wrong. While attacking this error message always shows up.,4
Good game. But I have lost my gems many time in my account and I have also reported it but no response comes. I did not have used any gems the gems just disappeared and my gem cout come to zero.,2
"Why the world chat has been turned off???? i am having worst clans . Then I made a clan and no one is joining my clan, and the game is crashing very often I lost so much trophies for that, developer make the game uncrashable. FIX IT",1
It is an amaazing game. But I want something to be added -There should be an option to collect a limited amount of loot from our treasury. LOVE FROM INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳,5
"I like this game but the maintenance is become the great problem I think you should merely working on this mentaince problem I shared this with my friends for more enjoyment,and In fact they also play this with great delight Thanks for making such a great Game",4
Excellent game that allows you to play against others your level. You do not have to pay to win. A fair game where I have made several new friends.,5
this is the type of game that ive been playing for years yes you can easaly loose an account but if you sign into a supercell account your less likely to lose it other than that its great,5
I really love this game but the thing is i cannot open the app anymore it keeps kicking me out i tried to restart my phone but still the same i hope you can fix this as soon as possible,3
"Awesome game, whenever I do play, it never makes me bored, it's so cool because you would have to spend a long time on the game to master everything, and that's what I want in a game.",5
i can't log into my account . i've logged in through google play and it asks for an email verification which doesn't send any at all . same if i do it through supercell id .,2
This game is good but please fix the problem that when i open coc it goes black and automatically returns to the home menu and i cant open it i beg you fix it!!!!!!!,1
I like this game .but 1 thing is that in upgrading and building new things is so time taking and army training is also time taking and to speed up with gem is also so costly as gem mine produce gem so slowly make gem mine work fast. fix this issue plzzz and i will give it 5 stars.,3
This game was one of the first games I installed on the Google play store and has stuck with me for more than 5 years and all I have to really say is that this is a great game and if you're looking for something fun and entertaining this is the right choice,5
"Fun, strategic game with simple instructions and complex enough battles and games to challenge my mind.",5
"The game has been updated wisely, good job Supercell. I have been playing the game since 6 years and I really enjoy playing this.",5
"I hate the fact that once you are attacking in a clan war and then it disconnects, it would end up wasting the attack count.",1
I really enjoy this game helps with boredom But... I wish that everyone could have more than three builders because I always lose my gold!but still 5 stars,5
"The game is awesome.... But Keep more skin About Barbarian King, Archer Queen,Garden, and Royal. The skin that its was in games was not good keep more skin.",2
May i ask something? Why after update can't play clash of clans? I have enter this game more than twice still workout!!! Please fix this problem as soon as possible,5
I love rebuilding my base bc I have fun comin up with new ways to attack... Plus I get to test out my strategies and see what needs to be fixed or stronger.,2
this game is very good gam and is very unique and getting stuff like gold exlixr and gems are also not that hard but the reason why I gave only 4 stars is because whenever we upgrade something it takes a very long time,4
"This game used to be so good, bye now it has become pathetic, This game lags my phone at the moment i install it or open on the device and if i remove it then phone works superb, Please fix this supercell.",1
This new update has crashed my game. Can't open it on my phone or tablet. Been playing since the start! Super irritating,1
New update is awesome supercell but my request is to decrease the training time might be very helpful for frequent play it is my humble request please consider in next update... Thank u super-cell and having a happy clashing.....😊😊,4
"This game is amazing, it's one of my favourite games and with this new updates i am loving it more,i had been playing this game from 5 years and have enjoyed all the moments i have played this game.",5
"Diamond Swor n, but I am a bit of an 6 the, which I have a great day out with a few minutes walk to the end up with the following week to view the locations, and I will not only the highest quality and value for money for our full range, and I will not be used to work be a good day for the first to review the the same time, I am a bit of the most important thing cells, we will need the following week, 2nd Edition, and the rest of the year, and I have a look forward, and a half have to be a good",5
"Th9 in crystal 1 league and another th9 attacked me for 40 trophies?? while i search multiplayer all the th9 only gives 2-6 trophies, even the th10 only gives around 10-20, is the trophy system random? please make it easier to rank up",1
I love this game it's so funny and fun but I have a cheat that you can have troops without elixir in the quick training tab please fix this and I think this is a big in the game.,5
"This is a cool app, I started playing clash royale first and thought why not try clash of clans? I tried the game and it was fun, the best strategy is I upgrade my towers when I am away.",5
great game .. but i wish that we can see who's online on our clan .. even if were not friend already. and i wish that we can use dark elixir for upgrading walls too ..,5
Thank you supercell. I always wanted to try out new ideas but because of resources I couldn't do so. But from this new update I actually can try out new attack without worry of resources. Thanks again.,5
"This game is really awesome... I really am addicted to it, the only problem is the gem mine is so expensive to upgrade... But overall the game is good",4
"Just introduce a extra lab seprate for dark elixir, or to upgrade 2 at a time a spell and a troop etc , it takes insane amount of time to max a th, also allow to use a hero while upgrading they are getting upgraded all the time not able to use em.",5
"I'm loving this game. You need a lot of patience to build your place up but in the end once you've got a good base going, your good to just max out the levels of them. It's a lot of fun and I just love the wars♥️♥️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑👑👑",5
Its a very nice game there are so many new things in updates the game is really good it has a lot of strategy and you can build thing and while waiting you can do anything like watch a show on the tv or watch yt,5
"Good game,, it's non addicting online game, but the problem is, there is a mismatch in clan war league ex. Th 7 vs th 13?? Its infair, i love this game hope you can fix it",5
i been playing this long time ago. but i hate how the game loading process works. it crashes and throws me out of the game.,3
"The game has all the basic stuff you should get from a strategy game, as well as good base building, and it's all done well.",4
"Seriously, stop screwing with the troops. Im sick of changing my army around right about the time I get one down packed you guys change troop mapping or nerf them. Makes me want to quit playing.",2
"The confrontation battles in the night side village are very boring and take longer than necessary to determine the winner of the battle. I hope to find a solution to this problem, thank you.",3
"Heroes, troops and the background goes black. The app also closes randomly. Please fix this.",1
"I tried to log into my other account and it said it was banned for 31 days, reason was for phishing? I was on the account yesterday. Fun game but issues with logging into other account prevents me from giving it a 5 star.",3
I would rate it 5 star because it's a really good game but the reason why i rate it 4 stars is because of the time upgrading things on coc. Specially when it's on a higher level. It takes days or maybe weeks to finish upgrading which made me lose interest sometimes. That's why i install and uninstall this game,4
"This is my favorite game ever. Sometimes it lag but that's only with no wifi.there are sooooo many,different strategies of attack and defense",5
This game is leget awesome btw I hate it when people attack you and they activate their sheild and I hate I attacked someone with my golems and wizards only the two motars killed us from far distance I destroyed the base but not the freakin town hall when I was destroying it the motars attacked me from distance I managed to break one down but second one killed my all units Dam that's why it's 4 out of 5,4
I am a pro and i will make sure that i will win every matches and give a great applause for coc owner and manager and players . Have a great matches here after and i will tell that i will rate it as 5 stars and its a good idea of making free train troops thank you supercell....and i like the bgm that tan tan tan tan....ok bye,5
"Been playing for several years, it's f2p friendly and the system is balanced, I also enjoyed the time with my friends and met alot of nice clanmates, this game is a masterpiece 💯",5
I started this game recently but I have enjoyed it so much to the extent that I became addicted to it in a matter of days and I have been experiencing any bugs and all so farr so..yeahh I recommend u guys try it,5
"I really hope you bring back global chat. Also, maybe if you can't do that, make an update where one can make private chat with their social friends. There's no point to be friends when you can't chat with them personally. Updated: I can't seem to make an in-app purchase. Idk what's wrong. Help me",5
I just hate the trophy that they give to you but when some attack me they get the same amount of trophy I lost and pls fix the dragons Iq because everytime I place him near some defense they attack the resources first pls fix this supercell,3
It is really my favorite game but for the past time i cant log in the loading bar does not move i have waited for 10 minutes my in game name is Arthur Callehan and i cant log into my supercell acount cause i cant enter the game it aint my connection it works fine on all my other appa,3
It still a good game but it get boring after a few months it take more time and waiting for ur builds to finish and it just get harder to make money but the new update is good but hard to understand,3
This game is the best game ever because u can attack ur friends villages yea maybe it does take a little while to get good at the game but ur friends can donate to u if u need any troops but if u want them to u need to fix ur clan castle 🏰,5
I find it very fun except that it takes a bit too long even if I am on a lower townhall and you should get a bit more ways to get gems.,5
yes to be honest i try to ratw five star but since globa chat has been cut it loose down my one rate cos it is where i get my coan build up with good members but after some years t suddenly happen so i rate 4 pls dont mine me anyway this is very addicted and suoer genius game which can improve our stretegy in our life time 😊😊😉😉,4
Day by day the fun of this game is coming to an end with all kinds of updates and comparatively increasing the working time without reducing it. Now it seems worthless.,3
"It's a great game, but there is one problem. Builder is not necessary to make a wall, but without a builder, you can't make a wall and you don't have minutes to make a wall.",4
"Best online game ever, its because it doesn't require strong network to play and i never met toxic player on this game instead they're all friendly and willing to teach if your a beginner.",5
Have a little problem during start or in short it gets lagging. Shown black screen. After all it is best 👍💯. Game.,5
It's a great game live it all except for the battle fee that's dumb you already use your elixer to make troops. The rest is good and you could add a troop who goes straight for the town hall,5
"It is fun, but later on the build time and upgrade time of structures becomes too long.",5
This game is soo good...😊 I love the updates ... And I would like to say that it will be much better if the developers will shortened the time needed to upgrade,5
The game and graphics are good and all also the mechanics of the game but it is hard for me to know who are the one's online like when I check in the clan chat I can see how many are online but I don't know which one's I jus wish for this to be in the next update,4
"After this #2nd june 2022 updet my coc isn't opening I try many tricks like restart, clear data, reinstall. But it still not working. Though it is very good game.",1
This game is so good and it has been a big part of my childhood. The game is addicting in a good way and it makes you want to get to the top and become a clash of clans titan! And the community is pretty chill. I have not seen any toxic person while I am playing this game. 10/10 pretty much.,5
"global chat is gone so u can't recruit, so don't try to start a clan. u can't achieve without a clan. Even if u have a clan, it takes years to achieve unless u r paying $$$$$ it used to be fun but not anymore",1
Iv had this game for so many years it never gets old iv spent alot of money but best part is you dont need to spend a dime to play and be the best this is the best mobile game ever it will never be topped to me,5
I'm in this game is 2 months my experience is really superb experience this game very cool and graphics is very super graphics and other towns and Builder base is very super and I'm enjoying the,5
It's good game but it's hard to connect account because I don't have gmail. It's gonna bit easier if you can connect your coc to facebook account.,4
"Clash, clans, and fun in general. Lots of things todo from campaign, clan wars, etc... most importantly being able to smite my enemies. I love the troops and what they've done with the game. I started on a different account around the 2010's and wizard towerd shot lightning. The game has changed a lot since then and I'm happy to play it.",5
"Ive been playing for a year and a half now and im at th10 then today i logged in and it was downloading content and then ot kicked me out and now i cant play it anymore, ive uninstalled and reinstalled but its still not working .pls fix this. Edit:the recent update just fixed my problem, so I'm bumping it back up to five stars.",5
I've been playing for 7 years and thorough out the years since I started playing it has lost people and these updates has good results for people it is a good game and the gold pass is OP,5
Good gaming app . Iam playing this game since six years. But upgrading is taking more time and resources. So we need additional builders,5
Perfect game for downtime and relaxing. Lost my phone and I'm impressed with super cell id for accessing my game account. So glad to pickup where I left off..😃,5
"Please make heroes available only for war attacks, even if they are in upgrade just like other defences, they work in war beeing on updagre in home base.",4
"I like this game since I was in the elementary days and also when I saw this on TV. The graphics is great, and the animation was good. That's all I can say thank you .",5
It takes a long time for a fighter to be ready for an attack which is a very annoying thing😡 The game would have been more popular if we hadn't had to wait 30 minutes for a fighter to come with an attack😊,3
I don't like how you can't set heroes to go after defenses first. They always go after resources first and die in stupid ways.,4
4 stars because I having problems in finding opponents I'm at champion league but mostly I find is crystal league and master league it's so hard to find someone that is in Champion league so only 4 stars I enjoy the game so much but not enjoying on finding opponents,4
"Its cool i have no problems playing it doesn't take a lot of space on the phone, its very good its basically a mind game. The only problem is that if you delete your account you can't enter it to make changes so please fix that and bring back the global chat please.",4
Just started playing and now I'm watching some tutorials how to put up some good defenses for my storage but it's kinda boring to wait and just gonna play other game or watch utube lol but I still like the game because on how fun it was,5
Sense new update every time the game opens it boots me out right away my clan is in a war and I can't get on to do my attacks if you fix it I will go back to a 5 star rating,1
"This is an AMAZING game! There are a lot of things to keep you busy, and you can make your village bigger and bigger! Although, everything takes forever to load, like if I want to train my troops,I have to wait for like 30 minutes, and my brother is in a much higher level than me, he has to wait for almost 2 hours! I love the game but if I were to fix one thing it would be the slowness",4
"Very fun game overall, I don't mind paying a bit for some convenience every now and then specially with the low prices that the games presents in its special offers. Best aspect of the game is the slow pace and time investment to achieve certain things and also having to outsmart the opponent's defenses.",5
Amazing game but late game is very slow and its very passive and I love passive games but the insane upgrade times are so long such as most times over a week for a upgrade that gives 2 extra damage to a cannon that is only used against 3 troops and spawned units from hero abilities but otherwise its a good game,5
"The game is very very good and I like it very much, specially the part where there no more resources needed to train or brew spells.",5
I just love to play this game and wow really make my timepass very good.And yeah its really complicated and have to give more time to level up and that makes more concern,5
I love this game I am glad that the progress making. I pray to get 10 trillion plyers so they have some more work This game is so good I love that we not lose elixir on atking for trophies,5
"Update 31 Jan,I'm here still encounter the same issue but the developer seems didn't care about me anymore.Yesterday,I'm success to open the app even I got kick later in-game but todays everthing I did can't log into the app.Hope at least leave some respond and I can't send e-mail(it keep state as queieng).My phone model Samsung Galaxy A10 and still have 2GB space...Update 30 Jun,it fixed",5
"I like the game but now I need to update it first so that I could play and my phone couldn't update it, I hope I could still play without updating the game. My phone doesn't supoort google services, help me out",3
"Hi . i spent 2500000 on the countries flags . but now All of them are vanished . if u deleted them from the game then get my golds back , and if it was the bug ,then fix it plz tnx for your concern",2
"Alright, so where is the update button for coc? I just skipped the update option when it popped out cuz I had no internet data enough but how do I update it now? I'm not talking about the 18mb update on playstore.It was 285 Mb something. Where the button???",3
I like this game very much but there is a glitch in cwl clan war league clans get extra stars without scoring them Please fix that as fast as possible other than that the game is very fine and good.,5
"a true classic, it puts Minions: The Rise of Gru and Morbius to shame. The time that the Hog Rider said ""HHAAAAWWWWWGG RIIIIIIDAAAA"" Changed me and my life more than Jared Leto's one liner: ""It's Morbin' Time."" will ever be able to. Truly a game.",5
Would rate higher as this game was good. After recent update i am no longer able to make in game purchases and blame is put off to others. Please fix!!!!,1
thats why this game becomes boring because of too frequent update and over acting filtered on chat even its not something bad. nonsense this game. thats why MOBILE LEGENDS is on the top because this game is nonsense!!! im wasting my 5 years playing this nonsense system!!,1
I love this game and all the stuff from strategy to just having fun it takes a while to learn different things about the game. Overall I think it's an amazing game.,5
I like this game its very intertaining and it teach you a lot of strategy for more serious plan to your village and troops to become more stronger player than the other ...,4
Overall good. But is there is the ppssibility of reconnecting the game that is lost due to internet crash?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 plz response kindly. Thank you!,5
"I love the game, but the new update won't update.. it gets to 100% downloaded, installs for like 30 seconds, then just tells me to update again.. my phone isn't full memory, and supports the os needed to run and install.. so idk what's wrong.. im using a Samsung A20 incase it's a phone specific issue.",4
WTH is wrong with it??? It keeps crashing as soon as I enter the game. Every freaking time!!!!!! Please fix it plzzzzz. 🙏🏻,2
"This game is so fun because it's such a good strategy game and because you can do a lot of other things like joining a clan, making friends, place troops down, and etc.",5
Its very addictive. but it takes so much time to upgrade buildings. That is the only problem i will say,5
"By far my favorite mobile game, been playing since th 10 was max, and it's come a long way. I love it so much, it holds a special place in my heart.",5
"Have been playing this beautiful game. Have gone up in levels. Quiet addictive and you may end up losing money if greed takes over. However, I've seen in battles, most often the AI provides your opponents with more tha double ranking and you lose heavily. In case if you win, you may not gain that highly. So your tryst continues, but your progress ceases due to tougher opponents provided.",4
It's so disappointing that I am a TH8 while I'm searching for attack why it's always showing to me a higher TH like TH10 it is not fair to attack the higher base level for lower level base hayst what a bias game.,1
"Nyc game ,,one has to battle with other clans ,,and building clan structure... Updating army and all of it.. Whenever you feel free can play because it need time to update",5
This is so fun game cause you learn to be wise when it comes to attack the enemy. When we say war we learn to deploy army step by step. Just like in real war its very scary cause have a lot of people died and destroy some buildings. So the good in COC are enhancing our strategy to attack the enemies village. Mine set ba😁,5
One problems after latest updates. China player can attack my base while i cannot revenge or even view his profile and base. Couldn't report player also. Please fix,4
"This game keeps crashing on me after the update on startup, and nothing I've done can fix it.",1
"I love this game, I have been playing for the past two years. It's really addictive The most attracted thing in this game is the clan. Clan is the only thing I play games for 😶",5
"I'm stuck in loadingscreen, tried posting it on reddit CoC page but got deleted instantly, now what am i supposed to do? I have multiple accounts on my phone and cannot log in on anny of then well i just can't load the game actualy.",1
"The new update (Clan Capital) has brought me back to Clash of Clans and it's been super fun besides 14 day building times. I don't feel like taking 2 weeks to upgrade something. It's so annoying. I'd buy the gold pass for reduced time but it is still a week and a half so I'm not buying it because it's not worth it. Additionally, clan capital doesn't add many medals either and there aren't any items to speed building upgrades up which is absurd, especially since most of my upgrades take 14 days.",4
"It's brilliant game. Addictive. Edit: I had leave playing game for sometime and uninstall it because it kept crashing and it became impossible for me to play game, or even enter the game. It kept crashing and few times it crashed between my war attacks. Please fix this problem. I really love this game and my progress in the game,so try to solve this as soon as possible.",5

It kept crashing and few times it crashed between my war attacks. Please fix this problem. I really love this game and my progress in the game...? Was this review helpful?",5
"It's dangerously addictive, and incredibly entertaining. My SINGLE gripe with it (That comes to mind)?: If an AI is faced with a lvl.1 wall vs a lvl.10 wall? ≈ 9/10 it'll go for the lvl.10... when they lead to the same target... It's... Stupid... And annoying and a time-sink and, and, and... But it is a great game outside of that Edit: nvm, 6/5 stars, occasionally P.E.K.K.A's will chase butterfly's like it's nobody's business, and I love that",5
This game is insane.This is the best game i had ever played in my whole life.The time for upgrading the building make it realastic and more exiting for the player.Due to all exellent features i rate it 5 stars.,5
I do love this game. I've been playing it for a few years and is always really fun. There are a few things I think need fixing. Builder Hall need more ways to get loot. It's taking for ever to get it done on super easy upgrades. Or nerf the prices. We need a different way to get medals instead of the clan leader picking who gets them. For one if you have 40 or 50 members in the clan. Thats just never gonna be fair. Or if the leader keeps picking the same people. Not fair. But that's it IMP lol.,4
Comeback player from 2017. I'm happy that this game improved a lot from the first time I played it. It has a lot of events that made the game emore njoyable and fun!,5
Awesome game but here is a huge problem so i will uninstall the game bcz of crash when iam starting the clash of clans it was start but in 1 second black screen was come and suddenly i was come on my home screen plz fix the problem and then i will give you 5 stars Thank you,2
"Its pretty fun, its great for when your just bored and you want to do something to do although you cant really play for too long after about an hr or so it starts to get boring but other than that its fun for when you like long term games that you would play daily. And if you are NOT a patient person then i wouldnt recommend but if you are then it might just be the game for you.",5
"This game.... I don't even know what to say about it. It's very nostalgic to even think about it. It ain't just some typical mobile game you play in your phone, it teaches you a lot about patience. This is one of the major reasons how I learned to be patient.",5
Well people that I using clash of the crane I thought it was a good game but it turns out it's not a good game afterall when it comes to using your Google Play cards it has a tendency of ripping you off from your Google credit my advice to you people do not use Google Play credit cards in your game township,1
I like it alot. Ive been playing for a few months cus my friend dragged me into it. And honestly all the hour ive put in i only remember fondly! 👍👍 10/10,5
"I REDOWNLOAD THE GAME, AFTER 7 YRS AND STILL LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME, BUT WHY YOU CHANGE EVERYTHING DEV.? YOU REMOVE WORLD CHAT ITS SO HARD TO LOOK FOR ACTIVE CLAN, AND I THINK THIS GAME IS DYING. PLEASE MAKE AN ACTION TO THIS. DONT WANT TO LOSE THIS GAME.",4
It's is so fun and just really time consuming and the only thing that kinda bothers me is that when u upgrade things and the time it takes is just outrageous Like the x-bows they take 2 days to upgrade to level 2 it's just crazy but overall I love it its and amazing game,5
I love this game cause it combines your attack with your defense and amazing clan competition and you can challenge your base against their attack. But they should make town hall 15 black or orange.,5
"Lets me get the game, but I can't even play it! I start it and it shuts off. Would be nice if they fixed this. -I am on Chromebook",3
"Great game, great texturea ans eveeything. It isnt too grindy and a builder pack is cheap. Played for about a week and am already Town Hall 8. Highly Recommend.",5
"Players who use money on this game(buying gold pass, shop offers) , max out thier village faster as compared to players who don't spend their money. I think that's not fair especially 20% builder boost and gold pass rewards.",4
I've been playing this game for a while now but I had factory reset my phone and when I try to log in to super cell I'd it does not send a verification code to my gmail,3
