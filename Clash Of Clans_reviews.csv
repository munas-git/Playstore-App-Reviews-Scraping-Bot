"I used play this game back in the 2016. I started it again from strach a few days ago and so far loving it. So many necessary changes have been done by the developers which makes it even more fun to play. If you don't want to waste hours and hours of screen on time in a game then this game is the perfect solution for you. You just open it a few times in a day, collect your resources, build, fight and you are good to go. On the down side the upgrades can take a really long time.",4
"This is a perfect game if you got the patience and don't want to spend a lot of active time in it. Just log in, collect resources, do a couple of upgrades and battles and you are set. This doesn't mean that the game doesn't offer enough challenge and deepness. Between the multiple ways you can play and the constant updates, there are tons of hours of gameplay here. On the negative side, the upgrades get really long after the first few levels and there's lot pay content. Overall a great game.",4
The game is one of the best strategy games available on this platform. It has live events and regular maintenance io keep the game moving smoothly without any interference. Recently the game has introduced more rewarding tasks and they are worth achieving. But still there are some issues to be fixed and I hope that it will be solved.,4

"love ittt, but I swear to God there's this some kind of annoying thing that keeps on happening on the game. my wifi is very good but everytime I open the game it takes so much time for the game to load, before this doesn't happen but then now it takes over 10+ minutes to load until I can play the game! sometimes it doesn't even load it and I have to always keep on re-opening the game. my phone doesn't have any problems, it has alot of storage and never lagged. please fix this.",4
Good game overall. Fun gameplay as it allows creativity with attack strategies and base design. Planning the growth of your base is also a thing which is why it's really fun if you have a goal in mind. You can mess up by rushing your TH too much but you can still fix it little by little. You can spend money to speed things up but hard work is what pays off in this game. Kudos!,5
Great game! Alot of fun! The one downside is the long upgrade times as you get higher. Especially the eagle artillery. U need a max amount of gold just to upgrade and the first upgrade takes 9 days. That is a bit ridiculous for only being the first upgrade (lvl2). Everything else was way less when first upgrading. I don't have a problem with paying more for upgrading when things get higher levels. But a lower build time would be nice.,5
"Months ago, I was having trouble with the game because I was not able to play it since it crashes on the loading screen. But now, my respect has finally came back after a few changes, and I personally like the idea of making troop training absolutely FREE, as in FREE—now we have zero-cost at training our troops on three modes! (and this is getting better and better)",5
"I love this game. Even years after my last time playing, I was able to easily re-learn how to play. One thing I don't like is how hard it is to keep your loot because you only get 2 builders and then must grind up to 500 gems just to get 1 more. Plus, upgrades get really long after the first few levels so if that is combined with the difficulty to get more builders without paying money, it gets frustrating at times. Other than that, I love the game.",4
"Amazing game. Really the only thing I would like to see changed is the little blue ""i"" next to how many builders you have. It's excellent that it shows what is left to upgrade before your town hall is maxed out, but i wish it had more information and sorting options. Sort by price, TIME, or level. Just a thought. Also, Some of the stuff at the higher levels is kind of ridiculous for how long it takes to upgrade or research. 4 days for a potion? That's kind of crazy.",4
"I just returned playing the game, so im enjoying it, but the only problem is not the time to build and upgrade buildings, it's that the challenge feature, why does it need too much time just because i modified my base, i think the challenge mode is really good to try to understand and fix the defenses of your base, and know how to attack, or just have fun with ur friends. I think taking out the time duration or lower its time duration would be great.",4
"Clash of Clans has become a truly classic must-have mobile game. Having played the game on and off for eight years (since 2014), I still enjoy it. Progress slows down over time, but their battle passes have helped compensate for it with their end of season rewards (which are free). The game involves strategically planning out your base to protect your resources while building armies to defeat enemy villages. You can also connect to a Supercell ID to save your progress across devices.",5
The game that survived from 2013 until now. Since back then it's very different. The amount of popularity this game has is absolutely huge. It has the simple ways and styles to play the game. The reward system is good and very clean graphics. One thing I don't like are those bots spamming join>promotes(link)>leave and repeat. I wish you do something for that kind of problem. 5 stars. Keep up the good work. Happy Anniversary!,5
It's great you guys are continuing to update this game because it's is a great game. But I think you guys neglect the builder base. Nothing much has changed with it since it's release. Would love to have some type of daily challenges or something like that. Maybe even add in weekly challenges which are a little bit harder and monthly challenges which are hard to achieve.,4
"I am both a user on an Ipad but also on a chromebook. It seems that they have taken a liking to apple beter than google as I have no issues running it on my Ipad. I would love for this issue to be resolved as so I can enjoy it on both devices instead of just one. I have uninstalled it more than once, shut my chromebook down multiple times and have it updated to the most recent update and it has yet to turn on. Please adress this issue promptly.",2
"Super fun to play, and the things to do are practically endless! I can upgrade my base, attack someone, talk to clan members etc etc. And it's not hard to progress like some other building games, there's enough resources to let you upgrade super quick, but sometimes you have to wait to get some, so your always progressing, but not exactly zooming through the game. It's perfect!",4
"Great game! Playing it from the past 5 years! Only thing I'd say, add a button to clear all obstacles or trees and stuff, so that if i had one builder, I'll assign it to clear all, adding all the 10s-30s to give an estimate time and amount elixir required. I guess this would be much easier clear out the ground. It's very annoying to wait for the builder to finish one and then second and on and on with clicking each time to do it. Please consider this!",4
"Redownloaded it and got addicted by it. I completely still love the game until now! My only problem is the visual look of the heroes. I wish the heroes look changes as the level progress , just like old times. I also have this problem about clan war. I lost connection when I attacked on war, and after losing connection, I lost an attack. I didn't deploy and troops yet though. Pls add a feature where you wont lose an attack when this happens",4

"The game is challenging and fun, now that training troops are now free, but I recommend to lower the time duration even just a bit when building, upgrading or something because some of it even takes days, well it's not that bad. I think that's where the thrill starts though the. To he honest his games keeps getting better and better now, keep it up!",5
"Been playing on and off for the last few years. Very little has changed. Same characters, same stuff to do, but nice game to burn time. Only drawback is that it would be great if there were templates to use for base design instead of having to design your own. Really becomes a pain when you get over level 8.",5
"It's brilliant game. Addictive. Edit: I had leave playing game for sometime and uninstall it because it kept crashing and it became impossible for me to play game, or even enter the game. It kept crashing and few times it crashed between my war attacks. Please fix this problem. I really love this game and my progress in the game.",5
"I started playing this game in 2015 and had several maxed out accounts. It has been a surreal experience and it is a very enjoyable game especially with the new updates that have come. The only problems I've ever seen is sometimes it unfairly matches you with higher level opponents and the sheer amount of time it takes to upgrade buildings at a higher level. In my opinion , things such as gold, elixir and dark elixir collectorsarmy camps and other less important things should take less time",3
"I used to regularly play this game before the recent update. After the recent update, as soon as I open the app, it just shows a black screen and crashes on its own. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app a number of times, but it still shows a black screen and crashes on its own. Please let me know how to fix this issue. (Will update rating post receiving any response and if the issue is sorted)",1
I would've given it a 5☆ but it just cost so much to level things up it isn't funny![ unless you spend real $$ ] The amount of time something is upgrading for is ridiculous!! Also you don't get to pick and choose the players you attack in the builder base! I would say about 75% of the time when I get matched up to someone that's a higher level than me! Other than those things I really enjoy playing this game!!!,3
"This game is awesome. Really fun, I've been playing for years and I absolutely adore it, and it always keeps up with updates. The one and only reason I didn't rate this 5 star is the game makes it to where it seems like it wants you to stay in a certain league. I'm off and on with Titan 3 and Champion 1, I'm a townhall 11 attacking 12s, been attacking 1 up since th9, and I'll get attacked by 12s and 13s losing 30+ trophies. I'd rather attack th 11s for less avaliable trophies. Still a great game",4
"I really like this game, been playing since 2015 and it's never get old, although I stop playing it many times but it's easy to comeback💙💙💙 Suggestions! Nowadays it's hard to lot because sometimes when you are going to attack we spend so much time searching enemy base with good lots than the duration of your attack, maybe we can get some setting where you can filter your attack like you can set amount lot you want or town hall level.",5
"great free game! I've been playing off n on for 7 years and love a lot about the game, esp how they've continued to add new things to help with the insane upgrade times/costs. Though I love that they do that, I do wish things didnt take 3 weeks and max storage just for 1 upgrade(late game). Also the pathfinding n matchmaking have been top cons of this game since day 1. they say they've fixed it but its still just as bad unfortunately. I do really appreciate that you can play truly for free tho!",3
"I've played this a relatively small amount of time compared to lots of other people, and i'm currently th8. So far, the game seems great. It does have flaws like say the upgrades that take 24 hours and above, or the builder base which is just kind meh and i think a lot of players just forget about it. So far though, it seems great, besides getting up tiered by 2 levels, (which they should probably change) the game is good fun.",5
I have loved this game for years but I have had problems with the latest upgrade (June 2022). I tried to install upgrades for few weeks but it never worked. Today i tried again and was able to upgrade successfully. Unfortunately the game crashes every single time it loads. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling many times. I even tried my account on another phone but get the same issue. This means it is not a bug from my end. Please help to fix this! I paid money for this season challenge!!,2

"I love the game. The only problem is the time it takes to upgrade certain things. Plus, I don't know why they make the builder base so dry I think they should make challenges. To add, I really love the game I have been a fan for abour a few years but I think that maybe lower upgrade time and add more troops and town halls",5
"I downloaded the game a few months ago,because I missed it. I really love the new features new sceneries, challenges, skins for heroes, and also the magic items it really helps a lot in making my base upgrade much faster. My only concern is that there is no chat system between ""friends"" we can only communicate by adding them into our clan, but some of my friends hasn't built their clan castle. It's just annoying sometimes I hope y'all add some chat system for our ""friends"".Thank you.",4
"I absolutely loved this game from the moment it came out until now. I never thought you would be able to improve the game with each update,but you never disappoint. I love the change you made to the troop training. I see it only costs housing space to Train your troops. I would just like to see an option to qualify for the championships on the game",5
"Its a great game at all, but I just wanna place this review as it seem that I'm not the only person encountering some sort of problem when logging in to the game. (Same as other) When I entered the game, it flashes the village I'm in, before kicking me a second later. I tried reopening the game, restarting my device and reinstalling the game, nothing happened and still has the same issue. I also tried opening the game on my second device and it also crashes. Wish this can be fixed very soon.",4
"I really like this game, been playing since 2015 and it's never get old, although I stop playing it many times but it's easy to comeback❤❤❤ Suggestions! Nowadays it's hard to lot because sometimes when you are going to attack we spend so much time searching enemy base with good lots than the duration of your attack, maybe we can get some setting where you can filter your attack like you can set amount lot you want or town hall level 15 😉😉😉",5
"love ittt, but I swear to God there's this some kind of annoying thing that keeps on happening on the game. my wifi is very good but everytime I open the game it takes so much time for the game to load, before this doesn't happen but then now it takes over 10+ minutes to load until I can play the game! sometimes it doesn't even load it and I have to always keep on re-opening the game. my phone doesn't have any problems, it has alot of storage and never lagged. please fix this. 1,190 people found",5
"The game is really good, the upgrades give good refreshing times for you to clear your head and attacks are really fun to plan out and execute. The only problem is that today, I got a glitch where all buildings are invisible and only show their silloette remain. It would be bearable if it didn't also happen with event bases. But overall, great game",4
"This is a very fun game and I really enjoy playing it! But the upgrade prices can be too high and also take to much time to finnish. This might be a way for us (the players) to waste more gems, and then buy more to use more money on the game and so, it raising a bigger amount of the same, but it bothers me quite a bit. If this could be changed to lower the prices just a bit I would put a 5 star review. No offence to the developers and again I really like the game.",4
"I really love the way the game is evolving and becoming interesting but, it could be better if we get something like High Graphcis. I mean, asking for a High Graphics for this kind of strategical game is a joke. But, I think we can get one. I really love the game and playing since 2016. Till now, we are introduced with various new updates which made the game interesting in a way but; the graphics are mostly the same kind. Though premium skins add a new flavour but, it could be better. I think!",5
"It's an awesome game I started playing 10 years ago when i was 15 but I have lost around 4-5 villages so far, it was impossible to recover them back then and there are other things that suck about it, but I totally recommend it, it's always changing and evolving, building times can be really long but you have several things to do in the meantime, although it is a pay-to-win game in a sense, as gems are found in small amounts and Macon out your village without them is extremely hard",4
It's a brilliant game and at this point it is a must have app. The only thing that I have problems with is making a second Supercell Id account on the same device. Making the first account with Supercell Id was extremely easy but the second account is where I find difficulty. I have through countless tutorials and still get it to work. I do not know if this is a bug or I'm just not following instructions correctly but I sure do hope you look in this and inform what the problem is. Thank you.,5
"A very satisfying game I can tell, that makes use of your free time rather than doing nothing. It's a good game that makes you interact with other players and lots of different challenges, it was fun tho, not until the national flags were being removed by its new update. But for me there's a lot to look about it, also the games overall quality is good so I'm giving it a 5 star rate.",5
"6 years now.... still play everyday! My friends and I use this for our group convo's and seeing how it needs, but DOESN'T REQUIRE, 5 min of daily maintenance and attention; it also helps to stay close/current with your family and friends you don't see often enough, in an interactive and exciting way. Rather than getting sucked into a social media app that is guaranteed to show you at least 1 thing that upsets you or saddens you. Plus they relentlessly add great new features. Thanks Supercell 👍",5
"Great game. It allows players of all levels to develop and continues to introduce new features after all these years. Quality of life updates have made the game have improved the game a lot. You can play the game without ever spending money, and you won't miss out on any functional aspects or features in the game. There are aesthetic features, such as premium skins (Costumes), and Scenery that can only be purchased with money, but it isn't necessary. Awesome game",5
"It's brilliant game. Addictive. Edit: I had leave playing game for sometime and uninstall it because it kept crashing and it became impossible for me to play game, or even enter the game. It kept crashing and few times it crashed between my war attacks. Please fix this problem. I really love this game and my progress in the game...........?",5
"This game is amazing. No other words but amazing. BIG HOWEVER, there's a big con here, and that's the upgrading time. I've just upgraded my town hall, thus unlocked many upgrades, that take 11 D-A-Y-S to finish. I get that there's a system where the player should put real money into the game, and this game is also ad-free which is a major plus considering other mobile games, but when the price is ridiculous long waiting times, I'd rather watch someone playing connect 3 games for 15 seconds.",2
"it is probably one of the best games in the world but tgere is a problem that we cannot shift the network if gone bad, it goes for restart after changing the network immediately also and if i lost my connection in the middle suddenlyafter i upgrade any defenses or something it won't upgrade and we have to do it again.Besides,it is a very good game,we don't need to play it for 24 hrs,it is good for us,we can get fresh and very good attack system in ths game and good characters,i am obsessed with.",4
"Amazing game with a lot of updates and new content. The only problem is the progression system if you upgrade everyday, and stay online everyday to farm it will take you 7 year to max that means if you're 11 you will be max when your 18.(Keep in mind most ppl don't play everyday)But they add even more levels so it will take longer this and the 2 weeks upgrade times are a big problem that they still didn't fix it makes it so hard for people that don't spend money to go to the highest level.",4
"My favorite mobile game I've ever played. I've been playing on and off for, I don't even know how long. The fact that this and Clash Royale don't have ads is one of my favorite parts. You don't have to watch an ad to attack or boost resources. Over all 5/5. The only thing I'd change is that some people that upgrade, but don't play will get into the lower ranks and just sweep the floor with the other player. Other than that though, an extremely good game!",5
"It's very entertaining and even though the upgrades may take long it does make sense, you're not going to be finished playing within like 2 months as you are with many games, to reach a maxed account it takes like 5-10 years, it's very free to play friendly but you can also pay for things if you want to, and they definitely aren't overpriced. Just overall a great game with all the options there are",5
"Love the game, been playing it for years and starting over gradually, but the builder base is a real mess when you compare it to the Town base, when battling you have a high chance to be matched against a stronger opponent, Immediately indicating a loss, losses mean not getting rewards, not getting rewards means no upgradesz and no upgrades means not getting stronger, which leads back to losing. It's an annoying infinite loop which could use fixing, for that, 4 stars",4
"Best game I've ever played so far nice gameplay and the quality to,but as we all know not a single game has no problem. The issue is when attacking and accidentally press the home button and restart the game when you load back in,the troop when attacking is invisible including the siege machine other than the heroes. Pls fix this because this issue that I just mentioned is just a small one This problem has more bigger problem thx in advance supercell and well because its good Ill give the 5star",5
"Nice game, but the building upgrade is rather slow, so very fast I cannot do anything already, maybe can make it more faster and more option of the event so that the player can play longer. Also can add the speed button in the battle because the battle have to wait for soo long to finish, player cannot do anything else while waiting, so boring. If this things are fix I would give 5 stars.",4
"It's a great game that's fun to play with many, many, many things to upgrade and to do almost all the time (unless you're maxed) and the satisfaction you get from finishing an upgrade or getting a three star but during the later townhall levels those many things that seemed fun early game just sorta got lost. The upgrades take forever to do and you just get overwhelmed from the things you need to upgrade. Despite that you can still max out a base without spending money which is always a plus.",1
To the Devs: Decent game overall. Replayability could be a lot better. Multi-day upgrades and slow resource accumulation make the game easy to forget. That matchmaking is awful. You're either being attacked by someone far more advanced. Or you're completely destroying a base that is easily overpowered. Troops that live through the attack are used up. Why? The townspeople are useless. Make them a part of the game. There's not enough strategy. How about a world map?,3
"Obviously the GOAT of mobile games. A little boring at times when upgrades take long, but the variety of ways to play makes it easy to pick up and enjoy. One of the very few mobile games that is not PTW, as purchases only make the game quicker. With 2 bases of your own and several others that the clan owns, there's always something to upgrade. Wars are great, CWL rewards are super useful, Clan Games are both fun and rewarding, and the events are always worth undertaking. Supercell's work shows.",5
"Overall performance of the game and how you fix the bugs are great but there is something missing and that is the builder base update, i think it needs more improvement for the flexibility of the game and to have diverse strategies to attack. That is all and I hope you can see this",4
"I don't know what's happening, game crashing and instantly disconnected while attacking and when reopening its say error. Sometimes my attack is not counted on multiplayer in history attack, i feel bad for that got me 2x with high loot but i don't know what happen till my attack end, no loot can i get. But i love the game, i think its only a bug, please fix it.",5
"you can't NOT love this game, 10 years old and it's still going strong, we get enough updates to satisfy our thirst for content and the gameplay is super chill, a kind of game that you absolutely love but don't take too seriously all the time, you just attack and upgrade and check up on it once or twice a day to get more loot for more upgrades, year and a half in and im th11, the progression feels like it takes just the perfect amount of time (minus walls and heroes) and yeah, definitely worth",5
"I love this game, it never gets old. The graphics is outstanding and it is not a money win game, which make it fair to gamers who cannot pay. But my only problem is how long it will take to upgrade something, I just finished upgrading to th 12 and it looks like it will take me a year to max everything out, please developers, do something about it, but otherwise, it is a fantastic strategy game which is easy to learn.",4
"Yeah it's awesome the game works perfectly and it's fun with no ads or forced purchases. I rate 4/5 because there's one problem. The multiplayer battles are filled with way to many copy paste villages. I understand this is a player issue but it is still annoying to have to constantly skip the ""best base YouTube tutorial"" style villages.",4
"The game is really fun, graphics are good and sound are nice. You can do many things and play it every time. But I have some feedbacks for you:1. Builder huts are very expensive. I think it will be better if you give more gems in events or make builder hut cheaper. 2. Upgrading walls is really expensive. 3. It's not good at finding opponents for attaking. It usually find someone with higher level which you can not attack or gain 3 star and Sometimes it gives only 2 or 3 trophies for hard attack.",3
"I would suggest a good feature to coc. I felt there should be an option to copy the layout of other players and able to paste in our building arrangements. Some people may not be good at arranging the best way possible, this option can help them. Or even you can give an option where you can randomly arrange your base based on random template on a button click.",4
"I have tried a large variety of game till now , but I got board with them within 1 week. But COC is different ,if I take a look on its front... It looks simple and pretty easy to master but as you keep updating your town hall , you will find that 1 tile distance can change the whole game. It's like you are arranging a chess board ..... I think it's a perfect game where you use your IQ, tactics and madness all at a time.",5
"Dear Supercell, Today I have updated the game and then all of the sudden, my game freezes when logging in and then the app closes. I've tried to clear the cache and force stopping it. This game is truly amazing and I've been playing since 2014. Once the bug gets fixed, I'll surely turn my review to 5 stars. Sincerely, jace342",2
"My only complaint is when you are fighting online or single player, your troops go the opposite way of where you want to attack. I've lost battles this way. Everything else? A-OK. It's fun, challenging and a great way to kill time. I've rated it a 4 star because of the clean graphics.",4
"My only real negative gripe with the game currently is that I get spammed push-notifications that don't make sense. For example, it falsely tells me if my village is being raided (shield will be activated 15hrs lol), or, my troop upgrade is done, even though I've logged in since then.. Otherwise, it's a good game especially to connect virtually with friends. I prefer the older versions of the game because I thought it was harder, like troops costing. But it's a different game from 2015",4
"I've been playing this game for a little over six years now and I still enjoy playing once a day or every other for a few minutes. The reason I rate this a 4 star is because this game either involves a stupid load money to spend of upgrading everything or years of your life waiting patiently for things to finish upgrading, but if you have the time or the money I would recommend this strategy game.",4
"Clash of Clans is an amazing game, with great graphics and good quality. But, a couple of things aren't amazing. You can't actually control where your troops attack and how, and I hate the waiting time for builds, it means I login once upgrade and leave. I get that a waiting time is needed, but this means I have too much money and no way to waste it. I can't interact with clan mates and also can't attack . Because I don't need money. So play the game, and join the clan Kings Brethren. Good day!",5
"I've been playing this game off and on since arround 6 months after it's release, and I've really enjoyed it, and I got back into it recently and I've been enjoying it, but with these 2 or 3 most recent updates both my accounts have been bugged, I could attack a base 5 times same placement, same tactic and the pathing will never be the same, clan castle I can either have siege machine or troops?? You guys said you fixed it but you didn't. I truly can't hate the game though.",3
It is a nice game with op graphics and features. It got some cool characters and dragons. The game require brain to play bcz it need strategies to attack the enemy base. You can upgrade everything and change the background. Recently it add a pixel king skin and background . It was for free.,5
"This game is super fun and stuff. I enjoy playing it and it helps me relax. The problem--and the reason I wont give it 5 stars-- is that I HATE how we have to wait for our builders to finish building just so we could upgrade our walls or place them. Like what's the whole point?? The builders dont even go to the walls when we upgrade them. I think it's a waste because then we have to use our gems that take FOREVER to earn, just so we could HURRY up our process to upgrade walls.",4
Please fix the crashing issue many people seem to be having with the game as of late. Some are saying maybe the game is just no longer compatible with their phone but my phone is literally a gaming phone and I'm having an issue. 10 years is a long time to play a game that all of a sudden can't stop lagging or stay open long enough to play a full game! 😭😭😭,1
"Hi supercell, thanks for making this game super amazing over the years. Unlike some of your other games, this one hits hard with nostalgia and is easy to progress as an f2p, so good job on that. My only conplaint is the training cost removal, which removes the importance of resource management. Hope you can add it back",4
"It's a pretty chill game, you just farm stuff and get better troops and defenses. One problem,not about the game mechanics itself, is that after the very recent update where free troops have been introduced, The game doesn't start. It very slowly loads up, then shows the new update's banner, then it closes itself. please fix it soon develepors, I am waiting very impatiently to try out mass witches and yetis XD",5
"For me this is an awsome game. It is really fun and it's free for such a game that's fun. However I do have problem is that you can't attack more than once on the same base in regular clan wars because after the first attack and something goes wrong you instanly know what you did wrong, which is so frustrating because then you can fix that mixtake on one base. Which I know wouldn't really make sense if there are still a few bases left. But when its 1 base then it would. But it's still good game.",4
"I first downloaded CoC years ago on my 1stgen ipad mini. Recently. After 3 or 4 years of not playing i saw some updates dropping and decided to go back to it. My ipad still worked and clash was still downloaded. However, my ipad wasnt able to support the current version of clash, and therefore losing my TH9 base. However, the game has changed im ways i can easily see on my second run. Having gotten to TH9 again inna fraction of the time, and effortlessly saving up gems. Much better game today.",4
"Game is crashing frequently, probability of crashing when I open it is 9/10. When open the game, sometimes it crashes, sometimes it shows black screen, sometimes it just show my home base and I can't touch anything., sometimes it crashes when I click on war button, it even crashes when l click on news button, and the most chances of crashing is when I try to switch accounts, it's really very annoying that game is just crashing all the time. Please push an update as soon as possible.",2
"Base on my experience on how I play this, it was good and fun especially when the new update where the army training became free it helps me a lot saving elixir. I just want to have a suggestion the game is good but the upgrade time became longer and longer especially when you reach th 9+ it takes days to upgrade something . My suggestion is, make a new building, like clock tower or any building the give boost to builder to build fast the same as in builder base. That's all the game was so fun.",5
I am playing this game for more than 4 years. I've seen a lot of changes in this game during this period. But as the time passes this game is no more fun. The concept of clan capital and this update of zero cost for training army made me sick. This game is no more ambitious as early I try to get more loot in deploying minimum possible armies because of the cost to train them. But now its gone.,3
"I've been playing this game since 2015 ig, is a great one. The graphics are really well developed, the structure of how the game works is good and keeps you motivated to keep playing (without trying to make you buy anything, they have some stuff to buy with real money, but no pay-to-win). Thanks for the application supercell, keep up the good work",5
I m playing this game from 5 years. It is the best game i have ever played because it is not like freefire or bgmi in which we have to play for many hours to complete the missions. We have to just train the army and attack for the loot and just keep the buildings upgrading which i don't think so that it would take too much time.,5
"Fun and enjoyable. I have been playing this game since 2013 and it has been a fun and enjoyable experience through and through. You can play this game religiously, on and off, free to play or spend money and still have a great experience. The battle pass is definitely a great option to progress faster without spending too much money. I would love to see a little more community events in South Africa but all and all an amazing game and Dev team.",4
"If your looking for a good game for strategy and base development this is the game to get, yes it's takes a bit on moving up. Its all worth it in the end though, but the only flaw is how much the walls cost past town hall 9 so if y'all can change that many people will be happy because it just drains our money that's the only thing that I think should be changed. If y'all can reduce it by 50% or even 25% that will be fine. Thank you for making a good game and keep making it better",5
"The update was really awesome! No troop costs would really make us players experiment with our attacks! There is a little bug though. It's from the Capital raids where it shows how many attacks you have left, it keeps saying i have 5 attacks left even though i used up all my attacks. Not much of a big deal but it's kinda annoying if other players experience it aswell 👍👍👍.",5
"While I've been playing C.O.C. since it first came out in 2013, the only thing I don't like is the update that now the goblin attack portion has such amped up cannons against attack that even giants of level one are essentially taken out as quickly as barbarians. The damage effect and speed are the exact same. Otherwise, the game is still just as much fun now as when I first started.",4
"They Say Old Is Gold And They Well Say. An amazing classic strategy game. Only of the few games which is not focusing on selling passes and showing ads. Got obsessed with this game twice and left it but the game was powerful enough to allure me and bring me back for the third time. Supercell's idea of a Supercell ID is amazing and keeps the progress saved. I would just like to say supercell to that there is no need to make the game, ladder, farming and loot easy.",5
"The game is great and is one of my favorite, though I'm a bit disappointed because lately the game always crushes for I don't know what reason. When I open the app, it'll went well and then when I'm finally in the game, it stops and the screen will turn black and I'm back in my home screen. Why is it like this always? The first time it happened, I let it pass but lately it happens more often. I can't even play the game now, it always crushes. 😞 Kindly fix this please 🥺. Ty.",1
"Ive played this game since december 2014 and im still playing, this is the only game on a phone that i will never stop playing, i might have some breaks from time to time but i always come back and i dont mind the long grind from TH10 and up but the auto upgrade when you are gone for an extended period of time is annoying when you try to keep everything lvl1 and i think that should be an optional thing that you can togle, but i still give it 5 stars bc its my childhood",5
"It is a wonderful game but please remove that annoying upgrade time from everything. The cost collection itself is time taking and then we also have to wait for some days to finish those upgrades. Please supercell , remove this time system instead increase the cost of everything but please remove this annoying thing from the game. Overall the game is superb. Thanks.",3
"Great game, very good for wasting time on a boring weekend. My only request is that, for capital hill upgrades, that you add some sort of log so that you can tell who upgrades what and when they did it. It would be useful for organizational purposes, I believe!",4
"It's a great game and fun but I liked the graphics of the heroes better when they first updated their graphics because now they just totally look like cartoon characters. Don't get me wrong though, if you like to stratrgize to win a match then I recomend clash of clans because there is a whole lot of strategy that goes into this game. There are tempting offers in thd game that help your progress a little however it is possible to be totally free to play with some patients.",4
One of the best challenging game I have ever played. I recommend every one who wants to play a game for a long period they can install it. I m playing this game from the last 2 years and day by day its becomes much harder and interesting. At a start of game 10 seconds were enough for a single upgrade now I have to wait almost 15 days for a single upgrade. At the start it looks like a boring game tho but later on its becoming enjoyable and challenging..i will give 5 stars for it keep good work.,5
"Dev, please fix the issue when player face a network problem. For example like recent case of mine, attacking in war league, all doing fine troops were deployed then the wifi symbol popping out and when i relogging the game, there was no progress and the base remain at 0%. Before this whenever netwrok problem occured, the system like calculate the stuff and whenever u log back in the game there's progress. Looking for a fix in this matter sooner.",3
"I enjoy this game a lot, the battle system is done well, the UI is clear, and the matchmaking is good. Only problem i do have is the amount of tine everything takes, for example upgrades can take from a few minutes to days, if i would change anything it would definitely be the waiting times.",4
"This comes from a long time player coming back to the game in 6 years. It has changed and it is now much more complex but one thing never changed, the fact that if you don't pay attention to it for every moment of every day, you're getting raided, and whilst I understand it's part of the game, I would love for there to be a peaceful mode that didn't cost gems but I doubt that's going to happen so I propose this, an option to automatically refill your shield if you hat the gems available.",4
"This game is really amazing, It has gave me the feeling of something no game could give, overall it's one of the best existing games in the app store, the updates are amazing, the characters look good, especially the Archer, the upgrades may take a long time, but it's still one of the best games i've ever played.",5
"I've been playing the game since it came out. I never had any problem with the updates. But now with this update, where the troops need no elixir to get trained, I feel that the game is too dumbed down for a complete experience. I can understand that now players can upgrade troops with ease. But finding the best strategy for attacking each base with different troops combination while being elixir efficient and defending your resources were some huge parts of the game. Now that's all gone.",3
"Used to be good, latest update causes constant game crashes when loading some accounts. Have to delete and reinstall the game then switch to another account. If I try to switch to the bad account the game crashes then I have to reinstall and switch accounts again. Edit, they fixed it with a patch the next day but I'm not changing the rating. Should have put out the faulty update in the first place.",2
"Downloaded this app like three weeks ago and I never have any issues about it. I loved the game where I even spent money on it so i could keep up with my clan. I updated the app this morning and I just couldn't load the game anymore. Every time I open the app it crashes, goes black and just logs off. I restarted my phone and everything but nothing changes. Too bad that I already spent money on it and now i have to uninstall the app.",2
"I really love this game but in earlier days there are more problems when I open this game..Yeah that is black screen issue... Please fix this problem... And I search for it.. I realize that its affect the software...And it's only because of graphics.. When I touch each and every buttons like shop,settings, changing base design the screen is turned black and comes out of the game ,even when search for attack sceneries are big isssues while attacking.. I humble request you to fix that problem",3
"Exciting game,great graphics,addictive also,but whenever I start searching players in multi-player battle it cames at connection error (first),a few days ago I claimed gold but it did,nt come into my storage I ignored but tomorrow it was repeated (second),when any player attacked on my base the trophies are reduced but more than it was showing in my battle log(third)there are many more excuses but after all it is a great game so supercell it is very amazing creation but you have to maintain it.",4
"I like this strategy game, it's very challenging and very funny, but there is something that really annoys me when upgrading in the builder base, that is, the walls are too expensive, while the battle rewards are small, so it makes me dissatisfied because it takes a long time to upgrade all walls, I recommend that this be changed, thq.",4
"Why this is THE BEST mobile game I've ever played and I would recommend it 100% to everyone. It's, completely fun, sometimes challenging, great service if you lose your account, and no problems with the game! It also refreshes my mind everytime I play a little bit in my free time.",5
"This game is stunning. With the new update of clan capital, it became more interesting . I really enjoy playing this game but just a few months ago it started to crash. The moment I logged in it shows only black screen. I tried out several tips to solve the problem but still it's just the same so, I kindly request the developer to fix it.",5
"In this game you only have to check it once every day, or you can do battles and wars and etc. The only downside to this game is that at town hall 11 things start to go from minutes to complete to hours to days and then to weeks, it is a very long wait and the game has pay to win features for upgrading making it not fair for the free to play players. But overall good game I recommend this to people who play a little each day.",4
Been playing for 8 years or more I recently had an issue with crashing right after the game loaded. Messaged developers and with in 24 hrs the issue was solved. I've played other games and only get automated messages with no results. Thank you supercell for setting a standard and doing what you can to help your players.,5
The game is amazing. I really enjoy it but today when I was starting to upgrade my defenses. The game suddenly asked me to update it and after updating the game. I saw the troops in home Village can be trained for free now. This makes the game suddenly really easy and that's what I hate about it. I hate it because now the troops have no worth. You can use any troop you want for making raids really easy and I think this is wrong.,4
"Love the game. Full 5 stars. I have only one problem, now with the new summer update, i cant get into the game, it loads into the game and then shows the pop-up for the summer update that arrived, then the game kicks me out every time for some reason... Now i cant get all my rewards for reaching 4k points in clan games... Please fix",5
"I'm satisfied with the previous update. Although i do have a suggestion, though im not sure if it's already implemented but just in case it hasn't been, it would be great if you could add an offline timer to upgrades to notify us when an upgrade is finished even though we're offline, cuz as far as i can tell, you only get notifications for finished upgrades when you enable your wifi. And another thing, it'd be amazing if i can get multiple notifications throughout my accounts.",5
"It was the most wonderful game, I Ever played. I Like this game because of the good graphics, addictive and more....... So I like this game. I am waiting for the next updation of the game. THANK U for making this game.But I don't like the slow upgrade of the town hall and other things. And a another thing that we play multiplayer level we can loot the gold coins and resources of others, but we cannot loot their GEMS. Please fix the problem in the next updation of the game... 🙏🙏🙏🙏",4
"I really like this game. Its very addictive and play it all the time. I WOULD give it 5 stars BUT recently ive had an issue where, firstly it take 10 minutes to load, and secondly, whenever it finally loads it comes up with the ""bad internet connection"" symbol making it hard to play. I assure you that my internet is NOT bad.... its the game. Happy aniversary though!",3
"I wanna rate this 5stars but what i really hate the most is when i suddenly disconnected especially when attacking clan wars it doesn't reconnect. It was so frustrating that u cannot go back to the game and automatically lose those 3 stars. I hope it can improve soon, and and fix this issue in attacking.",4
"Very, very fun. The whole concept works so well. You can have fun with it how ever you want, whether thats trying to max out as quickly as you can, base desiging, trophy pushing, clan wars, clan games, builder base, clan capitol, etc. Always has and always will be one of the best mobile games of all time, I've never been bored playing it. First game I've ever cared enough about to review.",5
"One of the most stable and best graphic game. This game is perfect in its way. But apart from exciting gaming experience, one thing that i like the most about this game is that there is no rubbish and disturbing ads while playing it. Just smooth and very smooth!!",5
It was great until the last update came When I'm playing the game out of nowhere it kicks me out... happening multiple times a day... sometimes it doesn't finish up the loading from the opening screen even though my internet connection is ok... i also use mobile data for playing it but these problems exists. I use galaxy note 10 plus so i don't see any device issues here where I already play higher graphics requiring games. Please this game is something i love and care about. Fix it plz,4
"Enjoyable, the worst is to have an older tablet that didn't support new upgrade around the summer of 2022. Other then that it's more entertaining then barbies getting he man dressed in the morning. Or the newer games they have out that cost 50-60$ a pop. And yes you can buy gems and such to upgrade faster but with the monthly buy in of 4.99 or 5.99 is all you need and u don't even need that",5
"This game is fantastic! Everything is good and the events just spice up the experience! Except for one dangerous point that might get players lose their unsaved datas outside the game while playing, so basically when you use your phone which ram amount is below 3gb of ram will basically lagged the whole phone even crash the whole android system. (I hard reseted my phone for a lot time to clear up the ram and open the game without crashing)",3
"It's been completely broken for chromebook for around a year now, I've tried numerous ways to get it to work, all result in failure. When I open the game it shows me a dark screen then crashes, and after doing this a few times it gives me the: 'Clash of Clans has stopped responding' message. I haven't had any problems with this game on chromebook before it stopped working. Please fix this.",1
"June 2022 update CRASH.. CoC crashing since June Update App allowed me to make one Builder Base attack, then it froze and crashed. On restart it returns to Builder Base, freezes immediately and then crashes a few seconds later. I’m playing on an Android tablet. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times with the same result. Anyone else having similar issues or know how to fix it?",4
"The game is wonderful but in the builder base when ever I fight someone and I get a higher score then the other person it tells me that I lost and that I lose trophy when I'm supposed to be gaining trophy and it has done it on ever device I own. If you fix you it, I will give the game five stars, other than that the game is awesome.",4
"I will never leave Clash of Clans. This will always be my number 1 (mobile) game of all time. It has so many fun and engaging things to do, new updates regularly, and great graphics. But best of all, NO ADS! It has NO ADS throughout the entire game. And you dont have to pay a penny for it. That is something bold about this game and I absolutely love it. Keep up the great work, Supercell.",5
"Great game, TOTALLY free to play! You can spend money and upgrade faster, but not needed. Takes years to max, but fun. If you do want to upgrade faster, $5 for the monthly pass is the best money wise, but not needed if you don't mind more grind and time. NOT P2W",5
"Relatively fun game. Easy to play. And easy to accidentally sink all your time into if your not too careful. Perfectly capable of spending minimum time on if need be. Overall very flexible. Base building is probably my favorite part. I feel it adds a sort of tower defense feel to the game. And raiding other bases is nice when you wanna flip the script a bit. I've had the game for many years now, and the updates have yet to slow. They seem to make new content fairly often. Keeping things fresh.",4
"A great idle app to check on daily. I've been playing for about a year now, and it doesn't have any bugs or things that will interfere with the gameplay. On my specific phone (Android, Cloud Mobile) the game will restart and make me wait through the loading again anytime I pause the app and go onto another screen. This doesn't happen on my other devices. If you have a poor internet connection this game is impossible to play.",4
"It was a great game,but now it has lot of bugs. My entire game slowed down. It's taking 2-3min☹️ to find opponents in multiplayer battles. Please 🙏,fix this issue supercell, it's really effecting my enjoyability. Don't say I have poor connection, bcuz i am using wifi and I have cleared cache and also even uninstalled, and downloaded new game.",2
"Ok so, I've been playing this game for years and just after this recent update, its has broken the game for me. Everytime I try to play, itll get past the loading screen and as soon as it fully loads, it will show my village for about 2 seconds while frozen, then immediately crash. I know it's not just my phone because i usually play it using bluestacks on pc and it crashes on both.",3
"Best strategy and interesting game I've ever play the graphics is good especially the troops, I never play a strategy game before, untill Clash of Clans exists, but, the trophy system is not balanced, i push trophy for like 3 raid for only 11+, 22+, 15+ trophies, but when i got raided, got 30-, 29-, 36-, like, it don't worth for pushing the trophy anymore, please fix this? . That's all from me, thanks for the Enjoyable game!",4
"Been playing this game for nearly 8 years now, and during this time it has been a constant and remains a part of my daily routine. It's probably my favourite chill-out game. I've had to restart my progress a few times because of issues with google play (nothing to do with CoC btw) but I've never lost interest in the game. It was also kinda nice to refresh and restart. I think it's one of SuperCell's best games, and definitely a favourite of mine. Here's to another 8+ years! 😊",5
"Supercell, ive been playing this game and progressed from townhall 5 to now, 10. And everything was going smooth, until the last update. The last update was good but it affected the performance. The game was laggy when i swipe the screen. It was so laggy, that i couldnt really enjoy it, not like before. I have 3gb of ram left. I tried restarting my phone, clearing cache and it didnt work. Please fix this issue. My device is oppo m3 pro. The ""lag"" Doesnt happen to any else of my games.",3
"Been playing for few years, but I stopped but some reason I forgor. After coming back for 3.6 years, I can say it's still a fun game, the auto upgrades is very cool and helpful and the little coming back tutorial is excellent, keep it up! 👍",5
"When i try to open the game it takes so much time to open. Also sometimes it does not even open the screen just freezes and it kicks me out. Storage is not a problem I have plenty and its the only app that does this. Despite all this which I hope you can fix, its my favourite game.",2
This game is very cool but i disappointed because when you upgrade the opponents and troops it have a long time to finished the upgrade and level up the opponents and also when you upgrade all thing in the game it has too much pricey. but the game is very okey for me that's why i rate it 5 stars . i hope that you will fix alot of things in the game,5
Super fun game. Word of advice: save all your gems for builders huts so you can build/upgrade multiple things at a time! I have fun as co leader in Our clan going to war twice a week. Lots of events come up and it feels like there's more to get excited about everyday . The versus battles are super fun too and really provides unlimited play . Love this game,5
"The only thing that annoys me a little bit is that some players have the number of trophies that I have, and so they have 11 level Baracks when I have only level 5!? That thing was very weird. Well, this game is very satisfying many times, it trains your patience and makes feel you like a great commander. I recommend it to you!",4
"While it's fun to play when waiting around wasting time, the upgrade cost & time is becoming more and more ludicrous as I keep progressing (mind you, I'm a near maxed Town Hall 12). Maybe the prices aren't terrible, but certainly the timing to upgrade is getting obnoxiously long. Higher in the ranks (Titan III), gets annoying when trophy pushing, most of who you're matched with is either too low in trophies but maxed Town Hall 13 or too high while being two town halls ahead of me & nearly maxed.",3
This game is super nostalgic for those who used to play this a long ago. I am also involved in those people. It's been 3 years since i played this last time. Now i am seriously suffering from nostalgia. As a matter of fact i left this game because of its time... I mean in old days the buildings took too long time to be upgraded and that was irritating. But now supercell has given ear to our requests and decreased the times... So now i can make my base adorable... Thank you for reading..❤,5
"This game keeps on crashing again and again. I'm unable to do a single thing!🥴 I don't know why is this happening, because my phone matches all the requirements you have mentioned. My device is Android version 11 and 3GB ram, I know the ram might be a reason for that. But please, if you can then please help me. Or get a new option by which I can reduce my graphics 🙏.",1
"Love this game but ever since the last update, it's been crashing all of the time. Especially on raid weekends. It crashes and eats my attacks. It crashes and I lose my base edits. It crashes when I try to donate Capital gold. It's really frustrating.",3
"I have a problem. Always when I entered into the game the screen gets black and where there is troops and building, there is blank. Do something,please. There is some problem in my game. When I command to update something, the game sofwear didn't take the command. Last I try to update the labrotory, but it didn't work. 😢😢😢😢",1
The game is really good and fun. However I have one problem this game can take way to long to complete. Just as a example I'm town hall 11 and it can take 5 days for me to upgrade my Archer queen however I can not use my Archer queen whilst upgrading. It would be really nice if I could use her or the upgrades for hero's are instant.,4
"Upgrading things at the end takes soooo long for no reason other than to make you spend money. I have been playing this game for 4-5 months straight after not playing it for 10 years, have max town hall, and upgrades take on average 15 -30 days to complete now. Can't get anything done anymore because of these long waits. It is a terrible mechanic designed to make you spend money to speed up the process and I am ashamed to have fallen for it. I'm fed up with it and uninstalling this for good.",1
It's a very interesting game. I am playing it from 2 years . Everything is good but I would recommend that after th 9 or above the timing to upgrade anything should be less beacuse it take too much time to upgrade anything and sometimes it becomes boring.So please settle it,4
I love this game I've been playing it for ten years. TEN YEARS!!! I've never played a game for that long it's a slow process if you're a busy person it's a good game cause the build times take long and som3times it feels unfair cause you will get attacked unless you don't attack which I recommend if you upgrade now here's the deal do the Google play n save it will save your progress which you don't want to lose cause this game takes a long time. This games fun when you get ahead at th 6+,5
"The game is overall good. I face only 2 issues. One is that the builder is very expensive to get and it's price increases with no. of builders you have. Second, the limit on builds is to much. Edit - i want to suggest that there should be a scheduler for builders. For example at a specific time 3 of my builders should start upgrading the heroes and after that they build something else in the next 24 hrs.",4
Really amazing app honestly. I definitely recommend this app. The only bad side is how long it takes to upgrade things. It could take even up to weeks. But other than that it's amazing. A really good about this app that you can get creative with your base building.,4
"Constantly crashing to black screen (with sound) on start up, and when switching from Home Village to Builders Base, attacking, etc. Not sure what's causing it, have uninstalled/reinstalled more than 3 times, still happening, cheers.",3
"The game is a classic. But idk why I need to clear my cache to make it not lag but if that was fixed then it would be 5*. It's literally unplayable when it lags. Like 0-5 fps when it lags. And not just for the moment but when I go back to my village, go to clan mates village, go to my builder village, go to the capital, attack in the capital war and just basically doing anything. Maybe this phone is trash but it shouldn't be the phones fault cause it doesn't lag in any other game I play. :(",3
"The game is awesome. But supercell please fix the bug. When I was entered the game ,the game was opened for few seconds then the screen became black . So I can't play this game. Please supercell fix the bug problem at an early.",5
One of the few games I have kept over time but this game more or less turns into a farm simulator where you pray someone doesn't 3 star you because they used Pekkas or dragons as they tend to demolish everything and not to mention that everything is super costly to upgrade and I'm not even going to mention the DAYS it takes just to upgrade a couple of buildings (yes some buildings will take an actual day to be done while it is also unable to help defend) also i don't like global chat being gone.,4
Bad Connection issues. I've had multiple instances now that the game just randomly disconnects from my wifi even though it works perfectly fine. It's cost me clan war victories and it's starting to get old. please fix the servers or what ever is causing this.,2
This is one of the best games I have played in my life but pls work on the ai of the battle machine and sneaky Archer and also the bomber coz it is so irritating when they go only for the walls. Also pls add Sparky to clan capital and also it would be nice if you could add a new feature which would allow you to assign more than one builder on one single upgrade or construction to speed up the process.,4
"The game is great, but for the last week and a half, I'll be in the middle of a battle and I'll get a ""connection lost"" message and the game will restart. I lose the battles when this happens and as a result, I lose trophies. I've lost almost 1,000 trophies because of this. Please fix it.",2
"Love the game but it just wants to crash randomly, especially when I'm in the middle of a battle . Game still keeps crashing in the middle of a battle, causing me to loose, extremely frustrating.",2
"Very nice and stratigical game, I really love the game and have been playing it since 2020, Well this is a wierd complain I know but I kinda liked when the troops costed elixir. It makes the game way simpler when the troops or spells don't cost anything but sometimes u don't have anything to spend elixir on so, I would really appreciate if the feature is back",4
"Starting yesterday when I tried to open my clash of clans. It says Downloading Content it takes so much time but in the it pops up saying Connection Lost and it keeps happening again and again and again. I don't know if this has something to do with my internet because our internet connection is good I tested it on opening other apps and speed tests and it works fine so I think the problem is mainly the coc app not my phone, nor our internet connection. Please Fix this problem",1
"Amazing game all around! Every new update spot on, making the game more fun, each time. This game has a very small amount of flaws, with a countless amount of redeeming quality’s! I’ve been playing this game for 4 years on the span of 4 different accounts.",5
"By the adventurous game i played it for over 3yrs,every games needs improvement and this game highly recommended,Pros,Smooth no lacks,time consuming process and actions also take place so all in all yes good ,Cons,improve its graphics,and mainly focus on its game structure""Town hall""so the players keeps moving",4
"Great and fun game you can upgrade you troops and base. You can attack other players bases and evolve into a great base. You level up and get millions of coins which you can use to buy traps , defense's, things for your army, and ect. Overall great game love to play try it out!!!",5
"I am facing a problem specifically with COC after I updated my phone to Android 12 (realme UI 3.0) due to presence of features like farmers and assistive ball in my phone, which keep on poping up which should only happen once a game starts. This thing as I observed was not happening while playing other games on my device.",3
"June 2022..constant crashes!! After playing since 2015 (7 years) with no problems.The recent late June 2022 upgrade,the app just crashes after the supercell splash screen appears and the game launches then freezes and quits. Uninstall and reinstall does not remedy. The game cannot now be played at all.Clearly a glitch that needs rectifying. As I now cannot play ,no doubt I'll lose trophies,ranking and loot.",1
"I love this game, I've been playing it for many years and it's overly addicting. After the last balance update the game has started stuttering (newer model phone) so it's four stars until then. I still honestly love this game and will continue to play it, the community is seriously special. Edit: stopped stuttering shortly, everything else still stands",5
I've been having a problem with the entire game. When you open up the game it turns my music off wich is pretty annoying and in no longer let's me screen recording when I'm trying to make a video. I know it's not a big deal so it would be unfair to take a star away but since it's such a good game I'll leave it at 5 stars. Please fix this problem.,5
". PLAY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!/// 7+ year 62 y.o. player. TWO maxed out accounts less Capital Peak. The first statement and last sentence are from my previous review. You made the superheroes much more doable⭐⭐⭐. I have some apprehensions re. the newest changes but so far-so good. Capital Peak is good, but is it enduring? The last sentence is still true. But with troops so cheap, just burning them doesn't hurt 🤔. When u don't use all of troops in an attack, it messes up the incoming lineup.",5
The same problem occuring with the game again it still just shows loading but does not start and vanishes the screen due to which it takes a much longer time to perform any task and they are not fixing this problem which makes game worst and demotivate to play... The clash royals is much better than this..u all are just pretending but not fixing the minor bugs and just giving rubbish upgrades..,1
"The game is AWESOME, love the clan capital and the raids medals we get. The game is fun and non addicting but one huge problem that face- the game rarely loads. I try to open the game, the loading screen shows and the bar goes full, but then the screen just goes black. This repeatedly happens and became tired of it so I had to uninstall the game. Hope you fix this issue so I can play the game again",1
"The game is a masterpiece, i have been playing it for years, but could never have thought that I have to give such a bad review. Every time i open the app it loads and then the screen goes black, the game and audio runs in background but the screen get black,sometimes green. It's become extremely hard to play the game, because it rarely opens. And even if it opens it sometimes crashes during wars . I request the developer to look into the matter at the earliest.pls do, as it's defiling the game.",1
"Awesome, cool graphics and very addictive. Best game I have ever played and it doesnt consume data. I so much love this game. The characters. The only problem I have with the game is the time it takes to upgrade buildings when you get to a particular town hall. The suspense of trying it out is really much.",4
Still pay to win.The new update really has nothing to offer the season passes are repetitive. Tbf it's just 2 grindy its take a lot of time and in the end u pretty much just wasting your time. There is definitely some incentive to buy the pass with all the ads surrounding it.I liked it yrs ago but it's really no change more like some tweaks. Cash grab game,1
"I've used tonplay this game along when it first came out. Was such a cool game, and even though I was comfortable spending £20 per month to buy in app purchases, the overall enjoyment was worth the cost. However, since it became an insanely expensive game to play, so unless to pay to play to win, you simply can not keep up with the updates and new gear needed to stay current. This used to be a 5 star game, these days I give it 2 stars purely because of how focused it is wealthy players",2
Pretty fun so far. Downside is the upgrade times get really long the further you get in. I also wish there was an option to watch ads to earn gems. Some things are confusing as they give you a new village with no explanation after fixing the boat.,4
"Game doesn't motivate you to play much, especially lategame. Upgrade times can go up to weeks, so even if you farm there's no point. Shields last from morning until evening, then for whatever reason you don't get attacked at all until about an hour before you log in. My thrifty personality doesn't exactly allow me to break/reduce the shield that I got, so in the end I only log in, collect resources and log out. Armies also take forever to train, so I can only do 1 or 2 attacks at a time at most.",3
"Game is fine, and entertaining, But when your clan gets invaded and wipes out the town every single time, Thereby wiping out any progress you made, it quickly gets old and boring. Especially when I destroy someone's town and get was less trophies than the same person attacking me. Makes everything I just did for the last 3 hours moot.",1
"Still fun to play after all of these years. Some of the quality of life changes are really helpful. Still needs bug fixes, the troop AIs (looking at you, Battle Machine) is kind of broken in some instances.",5
"Missing out on scenery sales and other stuff (including the 10th Clashiversary) is just crushing. These thing never come back either. FOMO is so heavily relied on, it's disheartening when you actually miss out. (Also, screw you for just giving the Pixel King away for free and demanding the other heroes be purchased. Predatory. ""First hit is free"" nonsense. ""Don't you want to comolete the set?"") I personally have had enough missing out and I no longer wish to play.",3
"Great game, but it takes too much time to upgrade heroes late game. Taking 5+ days to upgrade a hero each time is too much, so if you want to upgrade them by 10 levels, you'll be done after 2 months, which is absurd.",4
The game is great & quite balance. I have a lil bit of a problem with the notifications when I used a builder potion my notifications didn't went off & I'm sure of it because I have a personal ringtone that is very loud & clear so I feel like I didn't get 100% benefit of the builder potion I have used so I hope soon fix the problem that I am having.,4
"No game comes near this game. After tried a lot of games, I came to conclusion that this is out of this world game. The concept about elements and structure of the game is amazing. I don't have any shortcomings about this game. This game has all, it becomes your home, your family, you get emotionally attached to this game. You can progress, you can play with friends in a lot of ways etc. Amazing, just supercell keep sending it forward!",5
"The Game itself is good .The problem starts for the free2play group,this game takes years to max out and if u dont buy at least season pass then taking 3-4yrs i dont understand the need for 17-18d upgrades,like its a game after all and if u just wanna do a 2d upgrade, it can take 300 gems even though gems are very very hard to come by and resources are expensive as hell I would love to see an update decreasing time for upgrades and increasing magic items in free season pass and more free gems",2
"Classic phone game. The best from back in the day. Just started a new account after about 3 years i was like th9 working on walls. Fun to start all over after a long break. Seems to be a little more micro-transactions, hopefully nothing game breaking. 5 stars for now Edit this isn't my clash of clans. It's like they kept trying to balance things with more things. what a mess. You got like 3 villages now, how bout a forth with classic clash th10 max less crazy critters. 1 star til I get a reply",1
I enjoy the game too much in everytime I do my recreational things. I like clan wars and so much battles to suppress although I often to acquire a loss. I hope the company are more willing to improve regarding the designs towards the progress of the game that the players may satisfy to their own bondings with a few lessons may learn as well. Goodluck and do your job better at all time!!!💓,5
"Update...same as before: (hard to win on defense no matter what you do). The game has very good quality graphics, variety of troops, and events. Although, if you're looking to spend, then you might find some equal justice in troop upgrades. Just keeping it real for you 🧐! P.S. My village was recently attacked and none of my heroes were present to defend ( I took screenshots 😱 ).Therefore, check your replays!",2
Please do something about the network error.During the beginning of war attack a wifi symbol is appearing even though no problem with my internet. The wifi symbol is only disappearing after game is restarted and all progress in the war is lost.Even if we lost our data connection for half second whole attack is failed. Please do something about it.,1
"Might be the best mobile game to waste your time. It's fun and you have to use your brain to play, it isn't mindless. Base designing and attacking are all well put together. Nothing seems OP so far. I don't know how it will continue on, but the game right now ia great!",5
There has been a game breaking glitch lately where the game crashes the entire phone needing a hard restart. It triggers during the loading screen and it just almost always render my phone unusable. Please fix this bug because it really is infuriating for this to happen often,2
"This game is really great, but the upgrade time is just ridiculous, and the cost to. I know it's an important building but why does it cost so much. Hope you can improve this. Then maybe more people would join this game. Besides the cost of upgrades and the time, it's really a great game!",3
Amazing top notch game I cannot believe a game like this looks so amazing I've only got like 8 hours in and it's really fun I can see the strategy and I love how the game gives you a three day shield so you can advance in time but it also lets you go guns and glory with cancle shield or attack to shorten shield. The rank system is amazing and the gameplay is to five stars because I cannot believe this game has come so far,5
The game itself is a really cool game but there is one thing that supercell should fix is if your 3 to 4 times stronger than the person you're attacking you shouldn't be allowed to attack there should be levels because I keep getting attacked by people that are literally three to four times stronger than I am and that shouldn't be allowed at all,4
"This is a great game, but it keeps on having errors of client and server are out of sync whenever I attack, and I'm constantly losing trophies because of this. Please fix!",3
Why do town Hall bases that are above me by 1 or 2 getting 30 or so trophies for clapping my base but when I get matched with a TH base the same as mine or lower the trophy yield is no bigger than 15? How does that make any sense? Literally giving them free trophies from my base but I can't get matched with a base that I can hit properly? It makes no sense I'm literally a farm and I can't hit any base because they're way too difficult or over levelled.,2
"Literally paying money to get special time sensitive item boosts, and the game has kicked me out 7 times today and blocked out literal hours of game play and it just ""happens"" every time I'm using items I paid for. No gem refunds, no item refunds, just took my money and blocked me from being able to play and use what I paid for. Not to mention not being able to play on my breaks when I actually had time to. Support never cares about you. Save your money and time, don't play this game.",1
This is an amazing game I only wish I could be beta tester other than that I love this game I had to restart over and over before there was supercell I'd but I still love it zero training cost is amazing to it makes it alot easier to upgrade my troops I have no complaints . In my opinion there is no mobile game. It's all so balanced I'm very happy that someone created a truly non pay to win the only things you pay for is gems which you can get from achievements and skins for scenery and heros.👏,5
"The latest update broke my th9.. everytime I try logging into it, the game crashes and I have to clear all data to get the app to work again, but my 1 th9 everytime I log in it's on the builder base and it freezes. Contacted support in game and they keep telling me I'm in the wrong topic/category. I'll definitely add the last 2 stars once I get some help with this. In the meantime I'm pretty bummed out tbh",3
"I loved this game very much .Explore the dungeon, collect crazy weapons, dodge bullets and shoot‘em all up! “In a time of gun and sword, the magical stone that maintains the balance of the world is stolen by high-tech aliens. The world is hanging on a thin thread. It all depends on you retrieving the magical stone…” We honestly can’t keep making it all up. Let’s just shoot some alien minions! This is the game you have always wanted in your subconscious. Explore the dungeon, collect crazy wea",5
My game keeps crashing when i switch accounts specially while visiting the night base. In home village it has no problem but in night base the game keeps crashing after this update. Need to fix this asap because once I visit night base it crashes and I restart the game and it opens in the same night base and crashes again and doesnt let me do anything.,4
"Okay I give this a 3 in hopes of getting the attention of someone that can help me! After the update, everytime I try to open the game, it flashes an add, then immediately crashes. Ive restarted my computer, uninstalled, reinstalled the app...Please fix ASAP Im addicted to this game! Its a great game, when you can play it!",3
"Pretty good, less pay-to-win than most games of its type, though it is much faster to spend money. Prices to buy packs are typically low, however gems are quite a bit. Great game to play, loads of fun and hardly any lag, despite being able to play with people from the other side of the world. ¹⁰/¹⁰",5
"This is now the game I play quite often. It doesnt need a lot of attention; you just need to upgrade things every now and then. I am now town hall seven and I am pleased at how the game is slowly getting better and better. But when the free troops and potions update came out, it made it too easy. Not that I'm complaining, but now you can just get really expensive troops for free, which doesnt really help the lower town halls, yet give the upper town halls an advantage. So try it out. It's great.",5
"Been playing for 8 years now and still a daily ritual. The game is updated 3-4times a year with either new building or troop levels, balancing changes or new features such as the Clan Capital that's embraces working as a team. It used to be a right slog to get things upgraded but now with the season challenges, clan games, clan war league, shop etc, getting your village and troops etc maxed out are no longer a chore. A true, free to play (if you want) ad free game that combines strategy and fun.",5
so annoying! when searching for opponents they will appear above 2 level on your level.and if your city was defeated you will lost 30 points but when you attacked others citys it will give you +7 trpohies😂..can you make a fair searching not for trophies but by level.if only i can give this games with -5 stars i will.,1
"Great game, just a couple scuffs here and there. Every time i try to download this game i have broken texture. First time it was all flying units. 2nd time was all towers excluding my barb king. 3rd time my hog riders became invisible and i couldnt tell when to use my heal spells as there was no way to see how many there were in one area. Pls help! Alright nvm i got help from someone else who had the same problem and got it fixed in the end :) 5 stars for you!",5
Solid clan based farming game. multiple ways of playing with in game season pass and other ways to speed progress but not necessarily needed. Can make multiple profiles with different email accounts not the worst option having 2 to be able to gain more troops. Not for everyone but stood the test of time,5
"It's an amazing game with great detail and it's really fun too! There's so many different troops and buildings u can get, but the reason I've rated it three stars is because once you get far in the game, you have to just go in the app, upgrade some stuff, launch two attacks, then there's nothing else to do so you have to wait till tomorrow to do the same thing again",3
"The game is super cool. the game is fun, non addictive game. I had playing this game since so many year but recent one update came and I can't update it, it will go to 100% after that it again starts from 0% no network issue or storage issue. while playing this game if anyone calls me the game gets lag in other games there is no issue. iam extremely disappointed from this problem please fix it as soon as possible",3
A great base building game with plenty of challenges and achievements. Great PVP system too. A great game to sit down and play or to play for hours or on the fly. Also has a very good multi-player system for gaming with friends.,5
"My app's crashing the whole time. I've reinstalled it and it's still crashing. After a few times of reinstalling it, it directs me to play store instead of my home screen. Usually when a game directs a user to playstore, it means there's an available update but there are no updates available. Please fix this as soon as possible.",1
"Latest update with capital was huge, really huge, maybe bigger than what was needed, sending single gamers back to the start. I am playing it for years and 5 stars is still the score this game deserves. But I think I'll stop here. Thanks for all those nice gaming years. A rare game where you don't need to pay to enjoy and still be in equal terms with those paying.",5
"Amazing game, so entertaining and so fun, clash of clans is really just too good for the play store and everyone is lucky that it doesnt cost money, one thing i live about the game is that it uses barley any data and has no ads! If your reafing this and you don't have it installed get it it will change everything! <3",5
"Fun game, but I absolutely hate waiting for the opponent to finish attacking me after I've attacked him to see who has the better attack (builder base). I know their attack isn't live, so why am I forced to wait for it to finish? Edit - I give up playing the builder base. Nearly ever single attack I have to wait on a replay of that person attacking my base before I attack again. Stupid and pointless. Edit - Dropping to one ⭐ because the developer refuses to address pointless waiting on attacks",1
"game is boring just because of 5 builders and upgrading time was 7 days, 10 days thats the disgusting, and the while attacking game lost the network manytime, since a week i cant even open game just because of connevtion, but my internet working fine, no issue with other apps and game, this happened just to the clash of clane, i request you to reduce time of upgrading buildings, and troops, otherwise, you guys loosing the players.,",1
"removing national flags? really?? I would've expected supercell to add more countries to the lineup. not only is this less fun, but some of us have needed to reformat our bases or decorative setups to comply with having our decorations forcably removed. I don't care if we had our money 1000x refunded, it wouldn't have been worth the negative aspect of wishing I had my old layout of decorations back. I love this feature, & I included many flags I'm fond of. I'm disappointed & surprised by this.",2
I don't understand why the battle machine is do dumb. If i use a wall breaker for troops to go inside the battle machine will start clearing the outside buildings which is not even on the way even when that side is cleared it will go to other side but bot go inside. Sometimes it is so confused about what to do that it will go toward one building and suddenly change its direction.,4
"This game is very interesting & tricky. It is very good. But I have rated 4 🌟 in 5 🌟 as I have been confronting the black screen so many times. For this cause I have lost many good chances to win battles as a veteran & an invincible player. So, I request the developer of this game to fix this problem by an update. I am suffering in it since the update of clan capital.",4
"Ok I've played for years and had issues they still haven't fixed but the one that pissed me off most is the fact after you disconnect from a multiplayer attack it still goes, yeah that's fine and all but CLAN WAR it just ends the attack like bro I literally disconnected for 1 second like bro make your game better.",1
"Great game, especially now that they have reduced build times. Highly addictive, I wish there were more games like it! Great features, great gameplay and great graphics. The strategy elements are surprisingly deep which i love. This is my favourite mobile game, and it has been for years. LOVE IT!",5
Such an addictive game. I have gotten far in the game but does take a while to do upgrades the higher you go up. Some take up to 10 days or maybe more. I check the game about twice a day and that's perfect for me. But very enjoyable. Would recommend for people who stick to their games,5
Pretty fun game but you have to wait like hours for just one upgrade. And you can't really do a lot until your warriors are done and it takes a while if you are trying to get one that needs minutes to be trained. But this is a very addictive game.,4
The Game is fun and awesome to play. But one annoying bug that is ruining my experience is that anytime I go to type my keyboard wont pop up. It's very frustrating. Especially when I need to communicate with my squad. For that I will not rate this game any hire. Please fix this.,2
This game is amazing. I have been playing this game for a long time and I have always enjoyed it. I love how this game takes progression to get to a higher level. It just gets you eager to play! Everything about the troops and upgrades are all Ballanced. This game has to be the best progression/attack strategy game! The ambience is also outstanding. I also love how this game continues to have updates and new features! It's also great how it's not just one base but three. I recommend to try this!,5
"Great Game! Except after new update the game will crash and close upon opening it. I've tried reinstalling, wiping game data, and restarting my device. Not sure if anyone else is having the problem, but I hope it will be fixed in a future update.",2
"Hello Supercell,again I want to say you that COC is the most awesome and interesting game I have ever played. But from few days ago my game is just crashing like anything, when I open the game it crashes, when I end a multiplayer battle and come to my village it again crashes. Not only in home village but also in the builder base it crashes all the time. So, please fix these problem. I am a TH 12 player and not want to give up playing.",1
"I love this game so much, I've had it for years. But for quite some time I haven't been able to get onto the game because it crashes before its done loading. Pretty Frustrating because it has been my favorite game for a long time and really loved the people you meet playing it. But it's unplayable at the moment and hope it can be fixed",5
"Game won't load after last update and it won't let me log into my Supercell account. They never send me an email to verify. Maybe it's for the better. Taking 3 days to upgrade troops and equipment is enough, but 9 days!!! I get it, buy gems, pay to play. The costs quickly outweigh the benefits and can easily climb to hundreds of dollars...or you wait for over a week for one item to update.",1
The new game mechanics having to train troops without spending elixir is such a game changer. Now I don't have to worry about the resources for training troops. Instead I can now focus more on the upgrading side. Love the update hope you keep it that way. It really helps a lot in strengthening my village.,5
"Its kind of fun but you would expect the matchmaking on a game thats been out this long to be good. It is horrible, im placed against people with buildings and defenses I havent unlocked or built myself. Its impossible to compete like that. Ive played this style of game all my life but somehow have lost more than 2 dozen matches in a row. Horrible beginning experience. I just uninstalled.",2
"I don't play very often, haven't in a few years, but everytime I come back there is game play changes which is good. They just keep adding more ways to gain revenue and the time it takes to get loot and upgrades is still long.",4
"Awesome game playing since the start if this game and taked a brake for about 2 to 3 years and restarted. I dont have any complaints. Just one request, its hard to predict the way of the siege machine when it is deployed so i kindly request to add some requirement to know the way of siege machine when it is going to deploy.",5
"It's good game, graphics is great and the gameplay is so beautiful,the settings is good too but I encountered a bug or glitch that I found a base to attack and I get 3 stars but after that ends I got back in my base and the loot u took from that base is gone and I panic and check the attack history/log and it's not there as if that attack never happen,plz fix this glitch or bug all the effort of searching and the money I spent to search that base just to get nothing,fix it plz",2
Hey supercell you should change the setting of upgrade and skip the timer of upgrade of any building rather than walls and you should initiate the instant upgrde for every building just like walls as the building level get higher it's upgrade time is increased because it is taking so much time to max any town hall. Thank you and i request you to do the above and you should reduce the upgrde cost of higher town hall building.😊 And your game is very good and i am enjoying itsorequesttodotheabove,5
This is a good game for those that love to show how good they are at strategizing they're attacks and defenses. May take a little bit to adjust to upgrades that are only a week long once you reach TH 10+. It isn't even a pay to win kind of game for most people. I would recommend that you share this with your friends. 👍,5
"Lost the community feeling ,no meanful upgrades in main clash game only every 18 months, the balancing act only degrades the good troops and the de , becoming stagnant. Only the odd time give us info and more into worlds and not paying enough attention into the reason they started this game 10 years ago,Losing touch with what the players need and could use better management of the game . Clash on",2
"The game is good but the app shows problems from time to time, it does not start, or gets stuck in the loading screen, or closes suddenly, freezes etc. I have tried using it in multiple devices, but still shows the same problems.",3
The game gets boring after awhile especially when there are updates every 3-4 months. Maybe there should be small update every month and a big update every 4 months. Just so the game stays fresh. Also it doesn't help when all the updates have been adding stuff for the higher town halls only. Only major thing has been cost reduction and even still their needs to be more reduced cost for everything. I'm Townhall 11 and attacking isn't enough anymore. I have to buy things from the shop to keep up.,2
"The game is very good. I would like to give only 2 star ,because it's have lots of problem which so irritated me such like game crashed and glitch showing black on the screen and also lots of problem,, I just want to requested to the devloper of the coc. Please solve the issues of the game crashing . Thank you.",2
I absolutely love clash. The only thing I would change is the account verification. Because if you lose an email or phone number supercell won't help you in any way tp verify your account. Other than that this game is sound and a great strategy game. I've been playing ever since the release.,5
"The game will get boring if the upgrade time is long, please reduce it. Can you please add private chats for coleaders and leaders to chat and can you also add some bases for each town hall for us to practice attacking, I know we can do that with out teammates but what if we want privacy and want to attack without someone seeing. It will be great to change troops in this practice than requesting. Great game and I hope my suggestions will be added in the next update!",5
"Alright it's been fixed,, I can play again and I changed my rating.. Thank You Super Cell! 6/28/22 Awful update! After updating, now it kicks me out before I can even do anything. It crashes on all my devices. I've been playing for years, but if this doesn't get fixed fast I'll just uninstall it.",4
"Ever since last summer the connection to the game servers suck. I have lost hundreds of trophies and have been demoted 3 times because I'll start an attack, use 4 lightning spells then loose connection to the servers. I have 4-5 bars of both my internet and mobile data at all times with 200MB of download and upload speeds. Connection is not my fault, it's Supercells. Don't play if you like winning.",2
"I do really enjoy this game. Literally, I have been playing it for 5 years nonstop. The graphics, the troops and the upgrades are really over the top. Indeed, it did strengthen from my ability to attack other and villages and defend mine. It worth all my time.",5
"Fun. Can be played as simply or as complex as you like. I'm a thinker normally, but enjoy an occasional ""everything forwards and turn it up to 11"" attack... Game is generally stable but occasional glitches can be annoying. Jury still out on clan capital element of game.",5
